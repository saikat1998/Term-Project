Its governance framework enjoins the highest standards of ethical and responsible conduct of business to create value for all stakeholders. \n",
      "THE COMPANY’S GOVERNANCE PHILOSOPHY \n",
      "ITC defines Corporate Governance as a systemic process by which companies are directed and controlled to enhance their wealth-generating capacity. Since large corporations employ a vast quantum of societal resources, ITC believes that the governance process should ensure that these resources are utilised in a manner that meets stakeholders’ aspirations and societal expectations. This belief is reflected in the Company’s deep commitment to contribute to the “triple bottom line”, namely conservation and development of the nation’s economic, social and environmental capital.ITC’s Corporate Governance structure, systems and processes are based on two core principles:(i)  Management must have the executive freedom to drive the enterprise forward without undue restraints, and(ii)  This freedom of management should be exercised within a framework of effective accountability.ITC believes that any meaningful policy on Corporate Governance must empower the executive management of the Company. At the  same time, Governance should create a mechanism of checks and balances to ensure that the decision-making powers vested in the executive management are used with care and responsibility to meet stakeholders’ aspirations and societal expectations. From this definition and core principles of Corporate Governance emerge the cornerstones of ITC’s governance philosophy, namely trusteeship, transparency, ethical corporate citizenship, empowerment & accountability and control.  ITC believes that the practice of each of these creates the right corporate culture that fulfils the true purpose of Corporate Governance.Report on\n",

      "THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\n",
      "The practice of Corporate Governance in ITC takes place at three interlinked levels:\n",
      "Strategic supervisionby the Board of DirectorsStrategic managementby the Corporate Management CommitteeExecutive managementby the Divisional Chief Executive assisted by the Divisional Management Committee\n",
      "The three-tier governance structure ensures that:(a)  Strategic supervision (on behalf of the Shareholders),  being free from involvement in the task of strategic management of the Company, can be conducted by the Board with objectivity, thereby sharpening accountability of management;(b)  Strategic management of the Company, uncluttered by the day-to-day tasks of executive management, remains focused and energised; and(c)  Executive management of the divisional business free from collective strategic responsibilities for ITC as a whole, remains focused on enhancing the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the business to achieve best-in-class performance. The core roles of the key entities flow from this structure. These roles, in turn, determine the core responsibilities of each entity. In order to discharge such responsibilities, each entity is empowered formally with requisite powers. Report on Corporate Governance\n",
      "REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022 13 ITC LimitedTrusteeship recognises that large corporations, which represent a coalition of interests, namely those of the shareholders, other providers of capital, business associates and employees, have both an economic and a social purpose, thereby casting the responsibility on the  Board of Directors to protect and enhance shareholder value, as well as fulfil obligations to other stakeholders. Inherent in the concept of trusteeship is the responsibility to ensure equity, namely, that the rights of all shareholders, large or small, are protected.\n",
      "Trusteeship\n",
      "TransparencyTransparency means explaining the Company’s policies and actions to those to whom it has responsibilities. Externally, this means maximum appropriate disclosures without jeopardising the Company’s strategic interests and internally, this means openness in the Company’s relationship with its employees and in the conduct of its business. ITC believes transparency enhances accountability.\n",
      "Ethical Corporate Citizenship means setting exemplary standards of ethical behaviour, both internally within the organisation, as well as in external relationships. ITC believes that unethical behaviour corrupts organisational culture and undermines stakeholder value. Governance processes in ITC continuously reinforce and help realise the Company’s belief in ethical corporate citizenship.Ethical Corporate Citizenship\n",
      "Empowerment is a process of unleashing creativity and innovation throughout the organisation by truly vesting decision-making powers at the most appropriate levels and as close to the scene of action as feasible, thereby helping actualise the potential of its employees. Empowerment is an essential concomitant of ITC’s first core principle of governance that management must have the freedom to drive the enterprise forward. ITC believes that empowerment combined with accountability provides an impetus to performance and improves effectiveness, thereby enhancing shareholder value.\n",
      "Control ensures that freedom of management is exercised within a framework of checks and balances and is designed to prevent misuse of power, facilitate timely management of change and ensure effective management of risks. ITC believes that control is a necessary concomitant of its second core principle of governance that freedom of management should be exercised within a framework of appropriate checks and balances.\n",

      "SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAfter a tumultuous 2020, which witnessed unprecedented disruption to human life and economic activity across the globe, the world economy witnessed a sharp recovery on the back of enhanced vaccination coverage and continued fiscal and monetary stimuli across countries. As per IMF estimates, global growth in 2021 stood at 6.1% (Vs. 3.1% decline in 2020); Advanced Economies grew by 5.2% (Vs. 4.5% decline in 2020) while Emerging Markets & Developing Economies clocked a faster pace of 6.8% (Vs. 2.0% decline in 2020). The recovery momentum was, however, weakened in course of the year by new strains of the virus and an unprecedented spike in commodity prices due to global supply chain disruptions, container shortages and congestion in ports.Even prior to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, inflation had started surging in many economies due to soaring commodity prices and pandemic-induced supply-demand imbalances. This led central banks such as the US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and the Bank of England to bring forward the timing of tightening monetary conditions in their respective countries. The situation was exacerbated with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict that caused sharp escalation and volatility in agri, fuel and  crude-linked commodity prices. Persistently elevated and sticky inflation has emerged as a key concern globally. As per IMF, global inflation in 2022 is projected at 7.4% - the highest in 26 years. In some Advanced Economies, including the United States and certain European countries, inflation has reached  multi-decadal highs. In Emerging Markets & Developing Economies, rise in food and fuel prices poses significant risk to growth prospects. Consequently, central banks, the world over, are increasingly pivoting from supporting growth to combating inflation.According to the latest IMF estimates, aggregate global economic growth is estimated at 3.6% in 2022, representing a downward adjustment of 80 bps to earlier estimates. Advanced Economies are projected to grow by 3.3% with growth in major economies  such as the United States and Euro Area estimated  at 3.7% and 2.8% respectively. Emerging Market &  Developing Economies are estimated to grow by 3.8%, impacted by muted growth in China and sharp decline in Russia. The amalgam of recent events, including the latest surge in COVID cases in certain regions, continued geopolitical tensions, inflationary headwinds on the back of commodity super cycles & ‘greenflation’, and extended supply chain disruptions, pose significant downside risks to global economic prospects in the year ahead. FY 2021-22 turned out to be another challenging year for the Indian economy, marked by heightened uncertainty and volatility due to the COVID pandemic.  The year began with the second wave of the pandemic  having a devastating socio-economic impact in the country followed by a sharp drop in its intensity, which aided smart recovery in economic activity that reached pre-pandemic levels towards the end of the second quarter. Even as economic prospects started looking Management Discussion and Analysis \n",

      "REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022 39 ITC Limitedup, the country was hit hard by the third wave with new cases rising exponentially across major cities and halting the recovery momentum. Just as the third wave had abated in India, geopolitical tensions in Europe sparked off a fresh round of uncertainty in the operating environment.Amidst such a challenging backdrop, the Indian economy rebounded during the year growing by 8.9%, albeit on a low base. The Government of India continued to make concerted efforts, through several path-breaking initiatives across the areas of healthcare, infrastructure, social welfare and digital,  to support various sections of the economy during these turbulent times which helped accelerate the pace of resumption of economic activities over the year. These include an effective and focused vaccination programme, targeted localised restrictions during peak caseloads, support to economically weak sections of society and assistance to sectors most impacted by the pandemic. The recovery was, however, uneven with different sectors of the economy and income classes experiencing varying degrees of impact. The external sector was a bright spot in the economy with India’s merchandise exports surging 43% to a record high of US$ 418 billion during the year. Foreign currency reserves also remained robust, despite increase in imports with rising levels of activity. Tax collections remained buoyant during the year with record GST collections on the back of pick-up in economic activity, enhanced compliance and efficient administration. On the other hand, private consumption remained subdued and below its pre-pandemic growth path, rural demand witnessed a marked slowdown and private capital expenditure did not see any material improvement although signs of an incipient revival emerged in certain sectors. Unprecedented rise in commodity and crude oil prices led to persistently sticky and elevated inflation with March 2022 CPI hitting a 17-month high of 6.95%, resetting inflation expectations and the interest rate trajectory going forward. Up until January 2022, near-term prospects for the Indian economy seemed extremely promising – with all sectors of the economy, including the contact-intensive service sector, having made steady recovery. However, sustained inflationary headwinds and outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict leading to extended global disruptions and spiraling of commodity prices have led to downward revisions to the growth forecast for 2022. The Indian economy is now estimated to grow by 7.2% in FY 2022-23, driven by Government capital expenditure and anticipated pick-up in the private capex cycle. A favourable monsoon coupled with disruptions in global supply chains are expected to provide opportunities to  service overseas markets and aid the agri sector.  The Services sector is expected to grow at a higher pace aided by full re-opening of the economy and release of pent-up demand for contact-intensive services, including resumption of business and international travel. Continued geopolitical tensions, extended global supply chain disruptions and elevated inflation pose key downside risks for the year ahead. Even as the Indian economy faces multi-dimensional challenges in the short term, it remains one of the most dynamic major economies in the world with immense headroom for growth. A favourable demographic profile, rapid urbanisation and increasing affluence represent some of the key structural drivers of growth of the Indian economy.

      "40 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022 ITC LimitedIndia’s multi-dimensional reforms framework has the potential to unleash a quantum leap in the country’s growth agenda. Several transformative economic reforms have been undertaken in recent years to enhance competitiveness and foster inclusive growth. These include the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST), Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, direct tax reforms and revision in Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) norms. The National Infrastructure Pipeline, PM Gati Shakti, National Industrial Corridors, Smart Cities Mission and PM Awas Yojana are some of the key interventions that are transforming the country’s infrastructure landscape. The new Labour Code which has done away with a number of archaic legislations and investment boosting measures like sector-focused Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Schemes are expected to catalyse the manufacturing sector and enhance its competitiveness. A robust digital infrastructure has been put in place, with Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile trinity and several other initiatives under Digital India paving the way for democratising technology and connectivity to bring about the next phase of financial inclusion in the country. Focused initiatives in the rural and agri sector such as PM KISAN, Pradhan Mantri  Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), central scheme for Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and rural electrification programme amongst others, are expected to engender inclusive growth. As the economy faces the immediate challenges of muted consumption, persistently high inflationary headwinds and supply chain disruptions, policy interventions would need to be sharply focused on supporting sustainable livelihoods and fostering inclusive growth. The growth oriented initiatives announced by the Government in the visionary  Union Budget 2022 including provision of food, healthcare and social security benefits to the vulnerable, thrust on rural and agri sector, measures to raise farm incomes and focus on public capital expenditure to crowd in private investments are expected to bolster the growth momentum and also enhance competitiveness of the Indian economy. Structural support would also need to be provided to  sectors that have large multiplier effects on employment  and the economy. These include agri-based industries such as food processing, tourism, travel & hospitality and domestic agri and wood-based industries, amongst others. Development of robust value chains to support and strengthen these sectors remains  critical to achieving such multiplier effects and realising India’s goal of becoming a US$ 5 trillion economy.As reported in earlier years, enhancing agricultural productivity and value addition to international standards, while simultaneously improving  market linkages, remain critical to enhance  the competitiveness of the agricultural sector and drive  significant increase in farmers’ income. India is the leading producer worldwide of several commodities, including pulses, spices, fruits such as mangoes, bananas, etc.; it is also the second largest producer of rice and has the largest population of buffaloes globally. However, India’s agri exports aggregating appx. US$ 50 billion represent a global market share of less than 3%. Expert studies indicate the potential to double India’s agri exports by strengthening the competitiveness of agri-value chains in areas that are aligned to global demand and where the country has inherent advantages. This calls for a transformational shift  of the agri ecosystem from the conventional production-centric supply chains to demand-responsive value chains anchored by market players.It is pertinent to note that food and dietary patterns are fast evolving across the globe with sustainable Report of the Board of Directors\n",

      "REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022 41 ITC Limitedsourcing becoming increasingly mainstream. Such shifts accentuate the need to enhance the competitiveness of agri-value chains in order to cater to the dynamic market requirements of the future. Achieving scale and productivity have also become pre-requisites for the success of the agri sector.  As per estimates, over the next four decades, global food production would need to equal the total food production achieved over the past eight millennia,  in order to meet the burgeoning global demand over such time. The Government’s initiatives to promote FPOs in order to enhance market access for farmers and leverage economies of scale are expected to reap rich dividends for the agri sector in the medium term. FPOs have a tremendous potential to serve as major enablers in augmenting farm livelihoods, by facilitating a crucial link between markets and individual farmers, especially those with small and marginal land holdings. In this context, your Company has adopted targeted collaborative models to multiply the scale  and impact of its agri and rural interventions.  This collaborative approach, as opposed to a traditional  transactional approach, can contribute meaningfully towards building next generation agriculture that is climate resilient and capable of supporting gainful livelihoods. Digitalisation of agriculture also offers the potential to increase productivity and foster structural changes across the value chain thereby enabling efficient use of resources. In line with its commitment to bring the power of cutting-edge digital technologies and unlock the potential of India’s farmers, your Company has launched ITCMAARS (Metamarket for Advanced Agriculture and Rural Services).  This digitally powered platform will empower  the farming community by delivering customised solutions to stakeholders by synergistically integrating NextGen agri-technologies. Further details on this transformative initiative are provided in the  Agri Business section of this report.As reported in earlier years, it is pertinent to note that a substantial quantum of food is wasted along the chain in India, depending on the inherent perishability of the crop and the season. Higher levels of food processing in the economy can create a much larger pull for quality agri-commodities, thereby reducing farm wastages and raising farm incomes. This would require focused investments in developing  product-specific climate-controlled infrastructure as well as in branded products that benefit large  agri-value chains. Corporate participation is essential not only to invest in requisite infrastructure, but also  to provide assured market linkages to farmers.  A big thrust on India’s Food Processing sector can play a pivotal role and have a multiplier effect which will lead to significant job creation, enhance rural incomes and help manage food inflation. In this context, the recently announced PLI Scheme for the Food Processing sector, with an estimated outlay of ` 10900 crores, is expected to play a pivotal role in boosting investments, agri exports, farmer incomes, employment generation and building Indian brands for the global market. Your Company has been included under the Scheme for several of its Branded Packaged Foods Businesses, details of which are provided in the relevant section. Similarly, the Agro-forestry sector, as a source of raw material for wood-based industry, is woefully constrained by policies that not only impede job creation in India but also promote avoidable imports. Recent initiatives announced in the Union Budget 2022 to provide financial assistance to members of marginalised communities taking up Agro-forestry is a good starting point to reverse this situation. Supportive policies in this area would go a long way in enhancing sustainable livelihoods while simultaneously augmenting the Nation’s environmental capital.

Your Company’s interventions across operating segments are aligned to the national priorities of enhancing competitiveness of Indian agriculture and industry, generating large-scale employment opportunities and supporting sustainable livelihoods, driving import substitution by enhancing the competitiveness of domestic agri-value chains and industry, creating national brands to maximise value capture in India, increasing Indian agri exports and promoting sustainable business practices. Investments made by your Company continue to be guided by the national objectives of ‘Make in India’ and ‘Doubling Farmers’ Income’ and the overarching theme of ‘AatmaNirbhar Bharat’ that seeks to make the country stronger, resilient and more competitive.The collaboration with NITI Aayog, aimed at boosting agricultural and allied activities in 27 backward districts of eight states under the Aspirational Districts programme, was successfully completed during the year and plans are on the anvil to extend the same. Under the programme, around 34 lakh farmer interactions have taken place, with training being imparted on package of practices appropriate for the dominant crops of the region as well as towards livestock rearing. Your Company recognises the critical role of technology and the digital revolution towards fostering inclusive and sustainable growth to reduce social inequity. Towards this end, digital training platforms were leveraged during the year through customised apps together with the formation of more than 6,200 WhatsApp groups in around  18,900 villages, building capacity of 5.9 lakh farmers to achieve the objectives of your Company’s  collaborative initiative with NITI Aayog. These interventions have led to improvement in yields and reduction in cultivation costs, thereby augmenting farmer incomes by up to 60%.Your Company has also partnered with the  State Government of Andhra Pradesh towards improving the quality of chilli produced in the country to meet global standards. A Public Private Partnership programme - ‘Integrated Agri-Extension Platform for Chilli Farm Value Chain Development’ - has been conceptualised under which 40,000 farmers covering about 100,000 acres are expected to be benefited by 2025. In FY 2021-22, the programme covered over 16,400 farmers and 52,500 acres across 107 villages. Improved quality, farm productivity and higher share of farm gate sales enabled farmers covered under the project to generate additional income. Your Company is also working towards developing village level institutions and fostering micro entrepreneurship by promoting custom hiring centres for  farm mechanisation, post-harvest product management  infrastructure and community managed seed banks for self-reliance in quality seed material. Environmentally sustainable farm practices including zero-till sowing of wheat, direct seeding of rice, micro-irrigation and watershed development continue to be promoted. The farm sector faces enormous threats arising  out of climate change as evident from the growing  number of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. Given the vulnerabilities, it is critical to  strengthen climate resilience and adaptability of the agri-food sector. In this context, your Company’s  interventions in collaboration with CGIAR’s  ‘Climate Change and Food Security Programme’  to build climate smart villages was expanded to  over 2,500 villages across 11 states and supported farmers in the management of risks arising from erratic and extreme weather events.

While India is the world’s second largest consumer of tobacco, legal cigarettes constitute only 8% of overall tobacco consumption in India, as against a global average of 90%. It is pertinent to note that India accounts for less than 2% of global cigarette consumption despite comprising 18% of the world’s population, making India’s per capita cigarette consumption amongst the lowest in the world.Over the years, discriminatory and punitive taxation on cigarettes has led to progressive migration from consumption of duty-paid cigarettes to other lightly taxed/tax-evaded forms of tobacco products, comprising illicit cigarettes and bidi, chewing tobacco, gutkha, zarda, snuff, etc. Consequently, while the share of legal cigarettes in total tobacco consumption has declined from 21% in 1981-82 to a mere 8%, aggregate tobacco consumption in the country has increased over the same period. As a result, despite accounting for less than 1/10th of the tobacco consumed in the country, duty-paid cigarettes contribute more than 4/5th of the revenue generated from the tobacco sector.Taxes on cigarettes are one of the highest in India  as depicted in the chart.Taxes on cigarettes in India are multiple times higher than in developed countries viz. 17x of USA, 10x of Japan, 7x of Germany and so on. Further, the same is also substantially higher than that in neighbouring countries.

In 2017-18, the legal cigarette industry was further impacted by a sharp rise of 20% in tax incidence  as a result of increase in excise duty and transition to the GST regime.

Over the years this has created extremely attractive tax arbitrage opportunities for unscrupulous players indulging in illicit cigarette trade. While legitimate cigarette industry volumes have declined consistently over the last decade, illicit cigarette trade volumes, in contrast, have grown rapidly during the same period, accounting for about 1/4th of the domestic industry. During the year, the media reported several cases of evasion of taxes/duties by dealers in illicit cigarettes which came to light because of raids conducted by Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI). Several interventions in this area continue to be made by the respective authorities. As per the reply given by the Union Minister of State for Commerce & Industry in the Lok Sabha on 17th March, 2021, the seizure of illicit cigarettes has seen a quantum jump over previous years. It is estimated that on account of illicit cigarettes alone, revenue loss to the Government is appx. ` 17000\n",
      "1 crores per annum. In respect of the other tobacco products as well, the revenue losses are significant since about 68%2 of the total tobacco consumed in the country remains outside the tax net. Tobacco control measures in India have ranked amongst the most stringent in the world from the time of enactment of the Cigarettes (Regulation of Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 1975 to the present. India is also one of the few countries where tobacco products are regulated across the value chain – from their manufacture to sale to consumers. The Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 (COTPA) requires cigarette packages to bear the statutorily mandated pictorial and textual warnings covering 85% of the surface area of the packet - one of the largest in the world. It may be observed that smuggled international brands of cigarettes do not bear any of the pictorial or textual warnings mandated by Indian laws or, bear much smaller pictorial warnings as per the tobacco laws of the countries from where these cigarettes originate. As reported in prior years, findings from research conducted by IMRB International, an independent market research organisation, show that the lack of pictorial warnings on packets of smuggled international brands of cigarettes or their diminutive size creates a perception in the consumers’ mind that these illicit cigarettes are ‘safer’ than domestic duty-paid cigarettes that carry the 85% pictorial warnings. The combination of low prices to consumers consequent to tax evasion and the misleading perception created by the absence of statutory pictorial warnings provides significant buoyancy to illicit cigarette volumes.Report of the Board of Directors\n",

      "India is among the top three tobacco growing countries in the world. Tobacco occupies a pre-eminent position in the Indian economy on account of its considerable contribution to the agricultural, industrial and export sectors\n",
      "3. The large and rapidly growing illicit cigarette trade also has a deleterious impact on farmers and farm workers engaged in the tobacco value chain. In India, cigarettes are manufactured largely using Flue Cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco grown in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka. As smuggled international brands of cigarettes do not use Indian tobaccos,  in addition to revenue losses, the growth of  illicit cigarette trade has also resulted in a sharp  drop in demand for Indian FCV tobaccos in the domestic market. It is pertinent to note that several other major tobacco producing countries, including the USA, have established regulatory frameworks taking into consideration the economic interests of their tobacco farmers. The punitive and discriminatory taxation & regulatory regime on cigarettes in India continues to adversely affect the livelihood of Indian tobacco farmers with corresponding gains to those countries that have opted for moderate and equitable tobacco regulations. These developments, coupled with lower availability of Indian crop, lower export incentives in India and relative weakness of currencies in certain competing geographies have had a debilitating impact on 46 million livelihoods comprising tobacco farmers, farm workers, etc. who are dependent on the tobacco value chain. It is estimated that since 2014, Indian tobacco farmers have suffered a cumulative drop in earnings of over ` 7000 crores. As seen in the past, stability in taxes on cigarettes enables the legal cigarette industry to claw back volumes lost to illicit trade, thereby engendering domestic demand for Indian tobaccos, while also mitigating loss of tax revenue to the Exchequer due to illicit trade. As reported in earlier years, your Company and several other stakeholders had challenged the validity of the pictorial and textual warning covering 85% of the surface area of the packet prescribed under COTPA. The Honourable Karnataka High Court, by its judgement in December, 2017, held the 85% pictorial warnings to be factually incorrect and unconstitutional. Upon Special Leave Petitions filed by the Government and others, the Honourable Supreme Court has stayed the judgment of the High Court. The cases are pending before the Honourable Supreme Court. The extremely stringent regulations along with the discriminatory and steep taxation on cigarettes have had numerous negative, albeit unintended repercussions. These include:– rapid growth in illicit cigarette volumes, which resulted in sub-optimisation of the revenue potential of the tobacco sector and significant loss to the Exchequer. It is estimated that on account of illicit cigarettes alone, revenue loss to the Government is appx. ` 17000 crores per annum.– widespread availability of illicit cigarettes and other tobacco products of dubious quality and hygiene  to consumers at extremely affordable prices.  As a result, despite accounting for less than  1/10th of the tobacco consumed in the country, duty-paid cigarettes contribute more than 4/5th of the revenue generated from the tobacco sector.– a large component of tobacco consumption in the country, aggregating around 68%, remaining outside the tax net.

Discretionary/Out-of-Home  categories witnessed strong growth on a favourable base and surpassed pre-Covid levels driven by improved mobility and progressive return to normalcy.

In this context, it is pertinent to note that your Company is well poised to address adjacent growth opportunities by leveraging the 25+ powerful mother brands it has established over the years. Recent examples of such brand extensions include Aashirvaad to Dairy,  Ready-to-Eat, Vermicelli, Salt and Spices; Sunfeast to Dairy Beverages and Cakes; Bingo to Namkeens;  ITC Master Chef to Frozen Snacks and cooking pastes; Savlon to surface and clothes disinfectant sprays, sanitizers, masks, etc. Simultaneously, the FMCG Businesses continue to make strategic investments in building categories of the future and establishing your Company’s ‘right to win’ by progressively scaling up those nascent categories where beachheads have been created. Your Company  is also proactively pursuing value accretive acquisition,  joint venture and collaboration opportunities in strategic  areas towards accelerating growth and value creation.

The FMCG Businesses continue to create structural competitive advantages and enhance profitability by leveraging world-class distributed infrastructure, multi-channel distribution network, delayered operations, smart buying & value engineering and smart manufacturing anchored on the twin pillars of digital and sustainability. Investments over the years in several state-of-the-art Integrated Consumer Goods Manufacturing and Logistics facilities (ICMLs) have laid a strong foundation to drive structural advantages such as ensuring product freshness, enhancing agility and responsiveness of the supply chain, reducing  cost of servicing proximal markets through lower distance-to-market etc. Capacity utilisation at the  10 operational ICMLs continues to be ramped up along with focused smart manufacturing interventions leveraging automation and Industry 4.0 technologies to drive operational efficiencies, yield and energy management and further enhance safety and quality.

The rise of social commerce has created unique opportunities for brands to engage with their target audience using social media.  During the year, your Company launched its first social commerce event – ITC Store Jugalbandi –  a fusion of food and music, with the event being virtually hosted by ITC Store in association with  ITC Master Chef Frozen Snacks.Relentless focus on delivering superior quality products to consumers continues to be a key source of sustainable competitive advantage for the Branded Packaged Foods Businesses.

As highlighted in prior years, the Business continues to contend with increased competitive intensity post the implementation of 5% GST on branded atta. While it has been the Government’s intention to provide relief of nil rate of GST only to small and local manufacturers thereby benefiting consumers with lower priced staple products, many unscrupulous players have used this distinction in rates as an attractive tax-evasion/avoidance opportunity, by classifying their products as unbranded or with a declaration that all actionable claims or rights associated with brand identity have been foregone, while continuing to market the product with brand names and distinct trademarks.

      "HOTELSThe global Travel & Tourism industry has been severely impacted by the COVID pandemic over  the last two years. The industry’s contribution to global GDP, which had contracted to 5.3% in 2020 from 10.3% in 2019, recovered to 6.1% in 2021. As per estimates of the World Travel and Tourism Council, the Travel & Tourism sector, which had suffered 62 million job losses in 2020, could recover only 18 million jobs in 2021. According to United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), while international tourist arrivals witnessed a 4% increase in 2021 on a soft base, the same remains below  pre-pandemic levels by 72%. The Travel & Tourism sector holds prime importance for the Indian economy as well, with its direct and indirect economic impact estimated at appx. 10% of GDP (at pre-pandemic levels). The extensive tourism value chain spanning hotels, travel agents, airlines, tour operators, restaurants, tourist transporters and guides, etc. results in a huge economic multiplier impact, ranking it amongst the highest across industries on this count. India’s Travel & Tourism sector has also been severely impacted by the pandemic since early 2020. Domestic Air Passenger traffic declined by over 40% and international  tourist arrivals degrew by 87% during 2021 over  pre-pandemic levels, leading to cascading effect across the entire hospitality industry. After a severely disrupted FY 2020-21, India’s Travel & Tourism sector witnessed a smart recovery even as recurrent waves of the pandemic caused severe disruptions on an intermittent basis. Periodic restrictions on travel, public gatherings and restaurant/banquet operations induced by the second wave of the pandemic severely impacted the industry’s performance in the first half of the year. The Business responded with agility focusing on alternate customer segments and revenue streams, such as domestic leisure, staycations, long weekend stays and weddings. Receding intensity of the second wave of the pandemic coupled with pickup in the pace of vaccination gradually improved consumer confidence for travel; events such as weddings & social gatherings also enabled the Business to garner revenues. In the second half of the year, green shoots of recovery in business travel became visible, leading to improved occupancy levels in business hubs. While the third wave in January 2022 briefly halted the recovery momentum, the industry bounced back towards the end of the year with exit occupancies surpassing pre-pandemic levels and business travel sentiments improving. While Average Room Rate improved over the previous year, it remained below pre-pandemic levels.The Business continued to focus on its strategy of offering a host of curated propositions across accommodation, dining and banqueting to augment revenues across properties. This included  introduction of special packages offering value and flexibility targeting short getaways/staycations, revamped packages for the MICE (Meeting, Incentives, Conferencing, Exhibition) & wedding segments and extension of additional benefits to members of the Club ITC Loyalty programme.

PAPERBOARDS, PAPER AND PACKAGINGPaperboards & Specialty PapersAfter a sharp decline in FY 2020-21, global demand for Paper & Paperboards witnessed a growth of about 10% in FY 2021-22. Paperboards segment is estimated to have grown faster at about 11-13% on the back of robust demand from end-user industry segments. Higher global demand for virgin grades  and continued supply chain disruptions led to international fibre prices remaining elevated throughout the year. Writing & Printing Paper,  which had degrown significantly in FY 2020-21,  grew at a moderate pace of 5-7% with educational institutions and offices continuing to remain partially closed in the course of the year. The Indian industry witnessed broad based uptick in demand across most end-user segments driven by Consumer Goods, Pharmaceuticals, Food Service and e-Commerce.

The domestic industry continues to remain under pressure on account of cheap imports from China. The recent introduction of anti-dumping duty on Décor paper is expected to increase ‘Make in India’ opportunities and enable import substitution.Cost of key inputs remained elevated throughout the year. Besides a sharp increase in pulpwood prices, recycled fibre prices also ruled high due to lower collections/supplies as a result of pandemic led disruptions and high shipping costs. While the prices of key chemicals increased significantly due to strong global demand coupled with increase in crude prices & energy costs, coal supplies were adversely impacted by supply chain disruptions and prioritisation of domestic supplies to thermal power plants. Geopolitical tensions in Europe exacerbated the pressure on supplies of major inputs during the last quarter of FY 2021-22. In spite of these challenges, the Business responded to market requirements with agility to ensure uninterrupted supplies to customers.The Business continues to make structural interventions to reduce dependence on imported pulp, enabling substantial reduction in operating costs.

      "AGRI BUSINESSLeaf Tobacco A punitive and discriminatory taxation and regulatory regime on cigarettes, apart from providing a fillip to illicit trade and severely impacting the domestic legal cigarette industry, has also exerted significant pressure on the leaf tobacco crop grown in India. Excess supply from certain competing geographies coupled with weakness in their currencies has resulted in reduced demand for Indian tobacco in international markets, causing lower realisations for Indian farmers. Lower export incentives in India have adversely affected the competitiveness of Indian tobacco in global markets and impacted farmer earnings.  In addition to the above, the recent pandemic-induced disruptions in major consumption markets overseas have also impacted regional manufacturers in such markets, thereby reducing their leaf tobacco purchases from India. Consequently, Indian leaf tobacco exports have declined by around 20%  over the last eight years from 236 million kgs in  FY 2013-14 to 188 million kgs in FY 2021-22. However, during the year, global supply chain disruptions led to global manufacturers scouting for  alternate sourcing origins like India to ensure continuity  of supplies. Consequently, exports of leaf tobacco from India have grown by 8% over the previous year. The Business continued to leverage its crop development expertise, sustainable value chain and sustainability credentials, superior product quality and world-class processing facilities to strengthen its position as a reliable supply chain partner. Superior customer engagement, operational agility and supply chain efficiency enabled the Business to deliver enhanced value to existing customers and increase new business development. The Business consolidated its pre-eminent position as the largest Indian exporter of unmanufactured tobacco and aided in improving its market share by about 600 bps. Strategic cost management across the value chain continues to be a key focus area for the Business. The AI/ML powered smart buying platform continues to be scaled up to facilitate efficient leaf tobacco buying across auction platforms. Several initiatives implemented in recent years have led to improved operating efficiencies across manufacturing and supply chain.The Business continues to make focused investments across the tobacco value chain anchored on the key vectors of Quality, Consistency, Compliance and Sustainability. Crop and region-specific agronomic practices continue to be deployed to cater to the emerging preferences of customers. Synergistic R&D initiatives with focus on varietal development, climate smart farming techniques and usage of water efficient technologies are being scaled up towards improving productivity, product quality and reduction in cultivation costs.

Illicit cigarettes as well as smuggled New Generation Products (NGPs) and Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) in the country also impact leaf tobacco trade as these products do not use Indian tobacco. As seen in the past, stability in tax incidence and regulations lead to stable demand for leaf tobacco with the legal cigarette industry being able to recover volumes lost to illicit trade. Accordingly, a more balanced regulatory and taxation regime that cognises for the unique tobacco consumption pattern prevalent in India and the economic realities of the country is the need of the hour to support the Indian tobacco farmer and the 46 million livelihoods dependent on tobacco. Lower export incentives in India and unfavourable import duty levied in several markets, including the USA and Europe, have weighed on the competitiveness of Indian leaf tobacco exports. Restoring export incentives to earlier levels and necessary policy support to alleviate trade barriers would go a long way in enhancing the competitiveness of unmanufactured tobacco exports from India and contribute to increasing farmer earnings. Your Company continues to engage with policy makers on these matters.The Business will continue to provide strategic sourcing support to your Company’s Cigarettes Business even as it consolidates its leadership position as a major exporter of quality Indian tobacco thereby catalysing the multiplier impact of increased farmer incomes to benefit the rural economy. With its strong R&D capability, modern processing facilities, crop development & extension expertise and deep understanding of customer and farmer needs, your Company is well poised to sustain its position as a world-class leaf tobacco organisation.Other Agri CommoditiesThe operating environment remained challenging during the year due to disruptions in operations caused by the second and third waves of the pandemic.

      "whose findings and recommendations are reviewed by the Audit Committee and tracked through till implementation.Your Company has in place adequate internal financial controls with reference to the Financial Statements. These have been designed to provide reasonable assurance with regard to recording and providing reliable financial information; complying with applicable statutes; safeguarding assets from unauthorised use; ensuring that transactions are carried out with proper authorisation and complying with Corporate Policies and Processes. Such controls have been assessed during the year, after taking into consideration the essential components of internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Based on the results of such assessment carried out by management, no reportable material weakness or significant deficiency in the design or operation of internal financial controls was observed. Nonetheless, your Company recognises that any internal control framework, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations and accordingly, regular audit and review processes ensure that such systems are reinforced on an ongoing basis.RISK MANAGEMENTAs a diversified enterprise, your Company continues to focus on a system-based approach to business risk management. The management of risk is embedded in the corporate strategies of developing a portfolio of world-class businesses that best match organisational capability with opportunities in domestic and international markets, developing capabilities and competencies for the future in order to enhance competitiveness and win in the markets of tomorrow. Accordingly, management of risk has always been an integral part of your Company’s ‘Strategy of Organisation’ and straddles its planning, execution and reporting processes & systems. Backed by strong internal control systems, the current Risk Management Framework consists of the following key elements: – The Corporate Governance Policy, approved by the Board, clearly lays down the roles and responsibilities of the various entities in relation to risk management covering a range of responsibilities, from strategic to the operational. These role definitions, inter alia, provide the foundation for appropriate risk management procedures, their effective implementation across your Company and independent monitoring and reporting by Internal Audit. – The Risk Management Committee, constituted by the Board, monitors and reviews the strategic risk management plans of your Company as a whole and provides necessary directions on the same. – The Corporate Risk Management Cell, through focused interactions with businesses, facilitates the identification and prioritisation of strategic and operational risks, development of appropriate mitigation strategies and conducts periodic reviews of the progress on the management of identified risks.– A combination of centrally issued policies and Divisionally-evolved procedures brings robustness to the process of ensuring that business risks are effectively addressed.– Appropriate structures are in place to proactively monitor and manage the inherent risks in businesses with unique/relatively high risk profiles. – Foreign currency exposures continue to be managed within the framework of the Forex Manual. – A strong and independent Internal Audit function at the Corporate level carries out risk focused audits across all businesses, enabling identification of areas where risk management processes may need to be strengthened. The Audit Committee of the Board reviews Internal Audit findings and provides strategic guidance on internal controls. The Audit Compliance Review Committee closely monitors the internal control environment within your Company including implementation of the action plans emerging out of internal audit findings. – At the Business level, Divisional Auditors continuously verify compliance with laid down policies and procedures and help plug control gaps by assisting operating management in the formulation of control procedures.Report of the Board of Directors\n",

      "– A robust and comprehensive framework of strategic planning and performance management ensures realisation of business objectives based on effective strategy implementation. The annual planning exercise requires all Businesses to clearly identify their top risks and set out a mitigation plan with agreed timelines and accountabilities. Businesses are required to confirm periodically that all relevant risks have been identified, assessed, evaluated and that appropriate mitigation systems have been implemented. Your Company endeavours to continuously sharpen its Risk Management systems and processes in line with a rapidly changing business environment.  In this regard, it is pertinent to note that some of the key Businesses of your Company have adopted the ISO 31000 Risk Management Standard and accordingly, the Risk Management systems and processes prevalent in these Businesses have been independently assessed to be compliant with the said global Standard on Risk Management. This year, Agri SBU, Personal Care Products Business and the Life Sciences and Technology Centre were assessed for compliance with ISO 31000 Risk Management Standard. This is in addition to the six Businesses which were previously assessed for such compliance. The centrally anchored initiative of conducting external independent reviews of key business processes with high ‘value at risk’ continued during the year. These interventions provide further assurance on the robust nature of risk management practices prevalent in your Company. During the year, the Risk Management Policy & Framework of your Company was revised in line with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) (Second Amendment) Regulations 2021, inter alia, to incorporate (i) framework for identification of Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) related risks as well as sustainability risks, information risks and cyber security risks, (ii) measures for risk mitigation including systems and processes for internal control of identified risks, and (iii) Business Continuity Plan(s). Your Company already has systems and processes to monitor and mitigate the aforementioned risks. With the amendment, added emphasis is being given to these areas across your Company.The Risk Management Committee met thrice during the year and was updated on the status and effectiveness of the risk management plans. The Audit Committee was also updated on the effectiveness of your Company’s Risk Management systems and policies. A Cyber Security Committee, chaired by the  Chief Information Officer, is in place to provide specific focus on cyber security related risks, with the primary responsibility of tracking emerging practices and technologies and providing suitable recommendations for enhancing security of the IT systems and infrastructure. The Chief Information Officer, an invitee to the Risk Management Committee, is responsible  for ensuring that the Cyber Security systems of  your Company remain effective and contemporary. Cyber security controls are embedded in your Company’s Information Technology (IT) environment to ensure protection from risks of unauthorised access, unauthorised changes or unavailability of the systems. Key cyber security controls include secure configuration of enterprise assets and software, malware defences, periodic vulnerability and penetration testing, controlled access to critical business applications, appropriate segregation of duties and ongoing cyber security awareness programs for users. The cyber security framework of your Company includes specific checks and controls for your Company’s digital marketing initiatives and public facing websites. The framework further encompasses secure management of Mobile Applications and Industrial Control Systems (ICS).An independent agency has confirmed that  the practices in the area of Information Technology-Operational Technology (IT-OT) integration across major Businesses of your Company are adequate  and benchmarked to Industry.

      "Building Climate ResilienceYour Company recognises the urgent need to combat climate change for building a more secure future and the role it can play in enabling a net-zero economy. To this end, your Company is pursuing a low carbon growth strategy through extensive decarbonisation programmes across its value chain. These include increasing the share of renewable energy, continuous reduction of specific energy, construction of green  buildings, greening logistics and optimising  ‘distance-to-market’, and promoting regenerative agriculture practices in agri-value chains. Additionally, in order to identify long-term risks, your Company has worked with climate experts to conduct a comprehensive climate change risk and vulnerability assessment using climate models across its operating locations (factories, hotels, warehouses etc.). The assessment considered the impact of climate variables like temperature, precipitation, sea level rise,  river/coast proximity and extreme weather events over long-term time frames (2040-2060 and 2060-2080) under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios - RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. In line with the findings of the assessment, detailed site-specific assessments are being undertaken for risk mitigation and adaptation. Similarly, factors such as rise in extreme weather events, varying climatic parameters and dependence on rainwater for irrigation make agriculture in India quite vulnerable to climate change. For major crops like wheat, pulp-wood and leaf tobacco among others, there is significant and sustained work being done on the development of climate-tolerant varieties as well as dissemination of climate-resilient and regenerative agronomic practices in the growing areas. Detailed farm-level studies are also being conducted to understand the potential adverse impacts of climate change on your Company’s key agri-value chains. These risk assessments will help calibrate the climate resilience measures that are being implemented across your Company’s value chains.Energy Conservation and Renewable EnergyAs a responsible corporate citizen, your Company has made a commitment to reduce dependence on energy from fossil fuels.

In this way,  your Company has prevented waste reaching landfills and the associated problems of soil and groundwater contamination and GHG emissions, all of which can adversely impact public health. In the current year, your Company has achieved over 99% waste recycling. In addition, your Company’s Paperboards & Specialty Papers Business recycled over  85,000 tonnes of externally sourced post-consumer waste paper, thereby creating yet another positive environmental footprint.Your Company aims to go beyond the requirements of Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 to ensure that, over the next decade, 100% of packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable/biodegradable. Your Company is working towards optimising packaging in a way that reduces the environmental impact arising out of post-consumer packaging waste without affecting product integrity. This is being done in a structured manner by optimising design, identifying alternative packaging material with lower environmental impact and suitable end-of-life solutions for packaging waste. Your Company has successfully implemented multiple large-scale models of municipal solid waste management across the country.  These models, based on principles of circular economy, are scalable, replicable and sustainable, and have enabled your Company to become plastic neutral in FY 2021-22. The approach is centred around treating waste as a resource and ensuring that zero waste goes to landfill, which can be achieved only when waste is segregated at source. The initiatives focus on educating citizens on segregating waste at source into dry and wet streams and ensuring that value is derived from these resources and in the process support sustainable livelihood for  waste collectors and rag-pickers. These models operate on a public-private partnership basis with active involvement of urban local bodies, civil society and the informal sector of waste collectors.Your Company has exceeded its commitment on plastic neutrality made in the previous year, collecting and sustainably managing more than 54,000 tonnes of plastic waste across 35 States/Union Territories.

The programme has covered over 1.8 crore citizens in over 46 lakh households, 52 lakh school children and around 2,040 corporates since its inception.  It has promoted sustainable livelihood for over  17,000 waste collectors by facilitating an effective collection system in collaboration with municipal corporations. The intervention has also created over 140 social entrepreneurs who are involved in maximising value capture from dry waste collected. In Pune, your Company is spearheading a circular economy based on first-of-its-kind Multi-Layer Plastic (MLP) collection and recycling programme. In addition to WOW, a separate community-driven  programme on decentralised Solid Waste Management (SWM), in collaboration with  Swachh Bharat Mission, is operational in 17 districts of 10 states covering 14.6 lakh households.  This programme deals with both wet and dry waste and focuses on minimising waste to landfill by managing waste at source. Under the programme, more than 99,700 MT of waste was collected during FY 2021-22 out of which around 63,700 MT of wet waste was composted, 19,000 MT of dry waste was recycled, and only 17% of the total waste was sent  to landfills. Further, home composting was practiced by over 3.2 lakh households. In Uttar Pradesh, your Company partnered with the  Urban Development Department, leading to over 1,400 Government officials from 31 municipalities being trained on decentralised SWM till date.

      "enabling participation, contribution and asset creation for the community.– strive for scale with impact by leveraging government partnerships and accessing the most contemporary knowledge/technical know-how.Your Company’s stakeholders are confronted with multi-dimensional and inter-related concerns, at the core of which is the challenge of securing sustainable livelihoods. Accordingly, interventions under  your Company’s Social Investments programme are appropriately designed to build capacities and promote sustainable livelihoods. The footprint of your Company’s CSR projects is spread across 25 States/Union Territories covering over 200 districts.Your Company’s CSR interventions were conferred with two prestigious awards during FY 2021-22:– First prize in the ‘Best Industry for CSR Activities’ category at the third National Water Awards by Ministry of Jal Shakti, which was presented by  Shri Ram Nath Kovind, Hon’ble President of India.– Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI) CSR Excellence Award in the ‘Large’ category, for consistently demonstrating innovation and sustainability in managing CSR. The Award was presented by Shri Amit Shah, Union Minister for Home Affairs and Cooperation.Social ForestryYour Company’s pioneering afforestation initiative through the Social Forestry programme greened  over 30,700 acres during the year. It is currently spread across 19 districts in 9 States covering over 4.25 lakh acres in nearly 7,000 villages, impacting  over 1.4 lakh poor households. Together with  your Company’s Farm Forestry programme,  this initiative has greened over 9.5 lakh acres till date,  and generated over 173 million person days of employment for rural households, including women, poor tribal and marginal farmers. Integral to the  Social Forestry programme is the Agro-Forestry initiative including plantations on bunds, which cumulatively extends to about 1.8 lakh acres and ensures food, fodder and wood security. Further, fast growing, high yielding and disease resistant hybrid clones and saplings of eucalyptus pulpwood developed by your Company deliver significantly higher productivity vis-a-vis earlier clones.  The clones have been developed to grow under varying ecological conditions, thereby building resilience and contributing towards increasing  income for the farming community. Data from wood supplied by Mutually Aided Co-operative Society (MACS) shows improvement in yield by over 12%, primarily enabled through improved focus on promoting inter-crop practices in agro-forestry and farmer training on productivity improvement.Besides enhancing farm level employment, generating incomes and increasing green cover, this large-scale initiative also contributes meaningfully to the nation’s endeavour to create additional carbon sinks for tackling climate change.In addition to the above, the Social and Farm Forestry initiative of your Company, through a multiplier  effect, has led to improvement in pulpwood and fuelwood availability in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Odisha. Soil and Moisture ConservationThe Soil and Moisture Conservation programme aims to ensure water security for all dependents in the factory catchments and to drought-proof the agri-catchments to minimise risks to agricultural livelihoods arising from drought and moisture stress. The programme promotes the development and management of local water resources in  moisture-stressed areas by facilitating community participation in planning and implementing such measures, as well as building, reviving and maintaining water-harvesting structures. The coverage  of this programme currently extends to 40 districts of 16 states. During the year, the area under watershed increased by over 1 lakh acres, taking the  cumulative coverage area to over 13.3 lakh acres.  Over 3,100 water-harvesting structures including ground water recharge structures were built during  the year, creating nearly 3.5 million cubic metres of Report of the Board of Directors\n",

In addition, your Company continues to work with farmers to achieve ‘more crop per drop’  by promoting agronomic practices and micro irrigation techniques targeted towards saving water in cultivation and improving farmer incomes. Around  7.3 lakh acres have been covered across 11 states during the year; more than twice over previous year. Studies have been conducted by Vasantdada Sugar Institute and Tamil Nadu Agricultural University  to estimate water savings in sugarcane, coconut  and banana in your Company’s programme  locations. According to these studies, demand management practices promoted by your Company have led to potential water savings to the tune of  497 million cubic metres during the year.Additionally, your Company is continuing partnerships with multiple state government departments for  Soil and Moisture Conservation. Under the partnership with Watershed Development Department, Government of Karnataka, signed in the previous year, capacities are being built using your Company’s Water Stewardship approach to drought proof  100 watersheds across 29 districts covering  over 1.1 million acres. During the year, Government officials responsible for all 100 watersheds were trained to incorporate your Company’s drought proofing and positive water balance based planning.BiodiversityThe focus of the programme is on reviving ecosystem services provided to agriculture such as natural regulation of pests, pollination, nutrient cycling,  soil health retention and genetic diversity, which have  witnessed considerable erosion over the past few decades. During the year, your Company’s biodiversity conservation initiative covered  over 89,000 acres, taking the cumulative area under biodiversity conservation to over 1.3 lakh acres in more than 29 districts across 10 states. While the conservation work is being carried out in select plots of village commons, this intervention significantly benefits agricultural activity in the vicinity of these plots through soil moisture retention, carbon sequestration and by acting as hosts to insects and birds beneficial to agriculture. To increase the coverage for pastureland development and biodiversity conservation,  your Company partnered with Forest Departments of Maharashtra and Telangana, and Wasteland &  Pastureland Development Board (WPDB) of Rajasthan. The partnership with WPDB is targeted to cover 2.5 lakh acres across 8 districts. Further,  during the year, 475 Government staff were trained  for implementing the programme across 2,800 villages encompassing 34,000 acres. Sustainable AgricultureThe Sustainable Agriculture programme attempts to de-risk farmers from erratic weather events through the promotion of climate-smart agriculture premised on dissemination of relevant package of practices, adoption of appropriate mechanisation and provision of institutional services. Currently, 15.2 lakh acres and over 4.5 lakh farmers are covered under the programme, representing an increase of 71% and 77% respectively over the previous year. This has a significant multiplier effect in terms of adoption of sustainable practices by the farming community. During the year, knowledge was disseminated through more than 7,100 Farmer Field Schools and over 3,000 Choupal Pradarshan Khets. More than 610 Agri Business Centres delivered extension services, arranged agri-credit linkages, established collective input procurement and provided agricultural equipment for hire. In pursuit of your Company’s long-term sustainability objective of increasing soil organic carbon, more than 2,500 compost units were constructed during the year, taking the total number  till date to over 51,300 units.

During FY 2021-22, your Company supported around 200 FPOs across 6 states.The ‘Village Adoption Programme’ pioneered by your Company’s Agri Business presently covers 245 model villages in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. This initiative is aligned to the Prime Minister’s Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY), an initiative to promote holistic rural development. Under this programme, your Company is addressing the human rights and farm safety challenges in Indian farming by educating the farmers, labour and community and providing access to tools and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits for use on the field. Your Company had entered into a partnership with NITI Aayog in April, 2018, to improve agriculture and other allied services in 27 aspirational districts of  8 states (Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh) by training government officers who, in turn, would cascade the methodology to farmers. During the year, 5.9 lakh farmers from appx. 18,900 villages were trained digitally through WhatsApp groups, while over 6.1 lakh farmers were trained through physical sessions, taking the cumulative reach to around  34 lakh farmer interactions. Estimates indicate yield improvement of up to 30% for cotton, maize, paddy and soyabean in locations covered by the programme; similarly cost of cultivation is estimated to have reduced by nearly 15%, resulting in expansion of farmer incomes by up to 60%.The ‘Baareh Mahine Hariyali’ programme in select districts of Uttar Pradesh (Chandauli, Ghazipur, Prayagraj and Varanasi) is a pioneering initiative to facilitate farmers to enhance their incomes.  This programme is founded on a 360-degree, multipronged approach with interventions such as increased cropping intensity with a third crop during summer, enhancement of productivity through  context-specific agronomic practices demonstrated through Choupal Pradarshan Khets (on-farm demonstrations) and provision of market linkages with transparency in assessment of quality, price and  weighment. In some regions, taking a holistic approach to income diversification as an adjacency, livestock development, women empowerment and agro-forestry are also included. Over 2 lakh farmers have already benefited from the interventions under this programme – over 35,000 farmers who have adopted the package of practices reported doubling of income and those who have implemented the programme partially reported increase in their  incomes by 30% to 75%. Livestock DevelopmentThe programme provides an opportunity for households to improve their livestock-based livelihoods by improving productivity of the progeny  through breed improvement and dissemination  of improved animal husbandry practices.  The programme provided extension services, including breeding, fodder propagation and training  to farmers owning cows and buffaloes in 5 states and  18 districts. During the year, over 1.1 lakh artificial inseminations (AIs) were carried out which led to the birth of 0.5 lakh high yielding progeny. Cumulatively, the figures for AIs and calving stand at over 27 lakh and 9.5 lakh, respectively. In addition, the livestock programme also covered families engaged in goat and sheep rearing, enhancing their productivity through promotion of improved management practices.  Under the programme, 164 women trained as  ‘Pashu Sakhis’ provided extension services to over 16,000 households till date, thus enabling them to earn  supplementary income of up to `  5000 per month. Your Company is also working with dairy farmers in Bihar and West Bengal to improve productivity through several extension services and to facilitate higher milk production. Qualified teams comprising veterinarians and para-veterinarians have been deployed to facilitate animal breeding, animal nutrition and animal health services towards improving productivity and promoting commercial dairy farming among farmers. During the year, about 84,400 cattle of over 48,000 dairy  farmers across 507 villages in 8 districts of Bihar and 2 districts of West Bengal were supported through training programmes on clean milk production, mastitis control and animal husbandry services like deworming, ectoparasite control, etc. Report of the Board of Directors\n",

The Honourable Calcutta High Court, by its orders, allowed these writ petitions, and the proceedings in respect of these notices were quashed. The remaining notices are pending.Meanwhile, some of the prosecutions launched by the Enforcement Directorate have been quashed by the Honourable Calcutta High Court while others are pending.TREASURY OPERATIONSYour Company’s treasury operations continued to focus on deployment of surplus liquidity and management of foreign exchange exposures within a well-defined risk management framework.Market interest rates witnessed an upward trajectory during the year as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) commenced the process of Monetary Policy normalisation by way of gradual withdrawal of liquidity infused into the Banking system during the pandemic. Globally, inflation remained persistently high during the year due to elevated commodity prices and supply chain disruptions, forcing central banks across most countries to pivot from supporting growth to combating inflation. While the RBI continued to advocate continuation of accommodative Monetary Policy stance to support the incipient recovery in domestic economic activity, markets started to cognise for a faster pace of normalisation by the RBI, in line with global peers. In addition, higher than expected market borrowings budgeted by the Central Government for FY 2022-23 and spiraling commodity prices due to geo-political tensions in Europe towards the end of the year dented market sentiments and pushed market interest rates higher.Investment decisions relating to deployment of surplus liquidity continued to be guided by the tenets of Safety, Liquidity and Return. Treasury operations focused on proactive rebalancing of portfolio duration and mix in line with the evolving interest rate environment. Further, your Company’s ongoing practice of continuous review and monitoring of credit worthiness, including engagement with market participants, ensured that the investment portfolio  was not exposed to undue credit risks. As in earlier years, commensurate with the size of the temporary surplus liquidity under management, treasury operations continue to be supported by appropriate control mechanisms, including independent check of 100% of transactions by  your Company’s Internal Audit Department.In the currency market, the Indian Rupee (INR) depreciated against the US Dollar (USD) during the year. The weakness was attributed to strength of the USD relative to all major currencies during the year.  While the USD initially gained on the back of the US Federal Reserve tightening monetary conditions, rise in  geo-political tensions in Europe towards the end of the financial year triggered risk-off sentiment amongst global investors, aiding safe haven currencies such as  the USD. Lower capital inflows and a higher than anticipated Current Account Deficit also weighed on the INR. On the other hand, comfortable foreign exchange reserves and judicious interventions in the forex market by RBI provided support to the INR.

      "focuses on extreme competitiveness but in a manner that replenishes the environment and supports sustainable livelihoods. The strategic Vision of creating multiple drivers of growth through the pursuit of market opportunities  that best match institutional strengths, has resulted  in the development of strong Businesses of the  future as well as a portfolio of winning world-class  brands and future-ready products. Today, your Company is the leading FMCG marketer in India, a pre-eminent hotel chain and a globally acclaimed icon in green hoteliering, the clear market leader in the Indian Paperboards and Packaging industry, a pioneering trailblazer in farmer and rural empowerment through its Agri Business and a global exemplar in sustainable business practices. In the last two decades, your Company’s non-cigarettes businesses have grown over 27-fold and presently constitute over two-thirds of Net Segment Revenue. At the heart of this transformation lies the power of synergy, with seamless access for your Company’s new Businesses/initiatives to the deep and varied capabilities resident across different parts of the enterprise, and its world-class talent pool. An extensive strategy reset has been undertaken in recent years to architect the structural drivers that will power ITC’s next horizon of growth and ensure that the enterprise remains future-ready, consumer-centric and nimble. Each of your Company’s businesses has pivoted to create new frontiers for the future, with enhanced competitiveness as well as sharper focus on cost management to strengthen leadership or rapidly enhance market standing in the case of newer segments. As a core element of the ITC Next strategy, your Company will continue to explore opportunities to craft disruptive business models anchored at the intersection of Digital and Sustainability, the two defining trends in the ‘new normal’, leveraging its institutional strengths. In recent years, the FMCG Businesses have delivered strong revenue growth along with significant margin expansion, and are well poised to be rapidly scaled up. Multi-dimensional interventions have been made to strengthen the FMCG Businesses for sustained profitable growth. Following a strategic review of the business portfolio a few years ago, your Company  has restructured the Lifestyle Retailing Business during the year. At the same time, the product  portfolio has been strengthened in alignment with  new opportunities and enterprise strengths with sharper focus on fortifying the core, addressing adjacencies through world-class mother brands  and building categories of the future to power growth. To accentuate consumer-centricity, agility and enable sharper focus in the context of the growing scale and complexity of operations, the Branded Packaged Foods Businesses have been reorganised into market centric clusters with integrated and empowered teams. Focused interventions made in the recent past have also augmented your Company’s multi-channel  go-to-market capability, resulting in manifold expansion in the reach and availability of its products. Over the last five years, market and outlet coverage have grown 4x and 1.6x respectively while the network of stockists has expanded to 6.4x during the same period. Sharp-focused investments have augmented capability in emerging channels such as e-Commerce and Modern Trade, resulting in strong growth in sales and enhanced market standing; a new vertical has also been developed to address the fast-growing Food Service segment. In addition, investments towards accelerating agile and purposeful innovation with platform centricity, optimising supply chain efficiencies, digitisation and strategic partnerships have significantly enhanced competitiveness.  The impact of these multi-dimensional interventions is evident in the substantial margin expansion of 650 bps in Segment EBITDA over the last five years even in the face of significant inflationary headwinds witnessed during the year. The Businesses will continue to leverage your Company’s institutional strengths as a key source of sustainable competitive advantage viz. strong backward linkages with the Agri Business, a deep &  wide multi-channel distribution network, cuisine knowledge resident in the Hotels Business, packaging knowhow and the robust R&D platforms nurtured by LSTC. Structural advantages arising out of distributed manufacturing footprint, anchored on state-of-the-art ICMLs strategically located proximal to large demand centres, will be increasingly leveraged to drive rapid \n",

The focus going forward is on driving cutting-edge innovation to rapidly scale up single use plastic substitutes as a new vector of growth, building structural advantage through product mix enrichment and scaling up the use of emergent technologies such as Industry 4.0 to enhance operational efficiency, reduce wastage and costs.The Hotels Business has established a strong footprint of iconic properties and F&B brands on the back of an investment-led growth strategy. In recent years, the strategy has been reset to pursue an ‘asset-right’ growth path and augment revenue streams while simultaneously leveraging your Company’s world-class properties to drive growth. As reported earlier, your Company will continue to pursue alternate structures in line with industry recovery dynamics towards engendering the next horizon of growth as also enhancing value creation.

      "1.\t Significant\tAccounting\tPolicies\n",
      "Statement\tof\tComplianceThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with the relevant presentation requirements of the Companies Act, 2013. The Company adopted Ind AS from 1st April, 2016.Basis\tof\tPreparationThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for certain items that are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies.Fair Value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing  the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these  financial statements is determined on such a basis,  except for share-based payment transactions that are within  the scope of Ind AS 102 – Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 116 – Leases,  and measurements that have some similarities to  fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable  value in Ind AS 2 – Inventories or value in use in  Ind AS 36 – Impairment of Assets.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period; they are recognised in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.Operating\tCycleAll assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements based on the nature of products and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents.Property,\tPlant\tand\tEquipment\t–\tTangible\tAssetsProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. For this purpose, cost includes deemed cost which represents the carrying value of property, plant and equipment recognised as at  1st April, 2015 measured as per the previous Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).Cost is inclusive of inward freight, duties and taxes and incidental expenses related to acquisition.  In respect of major projects involving construction, related  pre-operational expenses form part of the value of assets capitalised. Expenses capitalised also include applicable borrowing costs for qualifying assets, if any. All upgradation /  enhancements are charged off as revenue expenditure unless they bring similar significant additional benefits. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of asset.  Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in Statement of  Profit and Loss.Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use which is generally on commissioning. Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated in a manner that amortizes the cost (or other amount substituted for cost) of the assets after commissioning, less its residual value, over their useful lives as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 on a straight line basis. Land is not depreciated.The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment of the Company are as follows: \n",

      "Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease. Property, plant and equipment’s residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and changes, if any, are treated as changes in accounting estimate. Intangible\tAssetsIntangible Assets that the Company controls and from which it expects future economic benefits are capitalised upon acquisition and measured initially:a.  for assets acquired in a business combination, at fair value on the date of acquisition. b.  for separately acquired assets, at cost comprising the purchase price (including import duties and  non-refundable taxes) and directly attributable costs to prepare the asset for its intended use.Internally generated assets for which the cost is clearly identifiable are capitalised at cost.  Research expenditure is recognised as an expense when it is incurred. Development costs are capitalised only after the technical and commercial feasibility of the asset for sale or use has been established. Thereafter, all directly attributable expenditure incurred to prepare the asset for its intended use are recognised as the cost of such assets. Internally generated brands, websites and customer lists are not recognised as intangible assets. The carrying value of intangible assets includes deemed cost which represents the carrying value of intangible assets recognised as at 1st April, 2015 measured as per the previous GAAP.The useful life of an intangible asset is considered finite where the rights to such assets are limited to a specified period of time by contract or law (e.g. patents, licences, trademarks, franchise and servicing rights) or the likelihood of technical, technological obsolescence (e.g. computer software, design, prototypes) or commercial obsolescence (e.g. lesser known brands are those to which adequate marketing support may not be provided). If, there are no such limitations, the useful life is taken to be indefinite.Intangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives by the straight line method unless it is practical to reliably determine the pattern of benefits arising from the asset. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized.All intangible assets are tested for impairment. Amortization expenses and impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses are taken to the Statement of Profit and Loss.  Thus, after initial recognition, an intangible asset is  carried at its cost less accumulated amortization and / or impairment losses.The useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed annually to determine if a reset of such useful life is required for assets with finite lives and to confirm that business circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment for assets so classified. Based on such review, the useful life may change or the useful life assessment may change from indefinite to finite. The impact of such changes is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate.Investment\tPropertyProperties that are held for long-term rental yields and / or  for capital appreciation are classified as investment properties. Investment properties are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Depreciation is recognised using the straight line method so as to amortise the cost of investment properties over their useful lives as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Freehold land and properties under construction are not depreciated. Transfers to, or from, investment properties are made at the carrying amount when and only when there is a change in use.An item of investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of investment property is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the property and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.Income received from investment property is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.Impairment\tof\tAssetsImpairment loss, if any, is provided to the extent, the carrying amount of assets or cash generating units exceed their recoverable amount.Recoverable amount is higher of an asset’s net selling price and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset or cash generating unit and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. Impairment losses recognised in prior years are reversed when there is an indication that the impairment losses recognised no longer exist or have decreased. Such reversals are recognised as an increase in carrying amounts of assets to the extent that it does not exceed the Notes to the Financial Statements\n",
      "154 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022 ITC Limitedcarrying amounts that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years.Inventories\tInventories are stated at lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost is calculated on weighted average method. Cost comprises expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing such inventories to their present location and condition and includes, where applicable, appropriate overheads based on normal level of activity. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs for completion and sale.Obsolete, slow moving and defective inventories are identified from time to time and, where necessary,  a provision is made for such inventories. Foreign\tCurrency\tTransactionsThe functional and presentation currency of the Company is Indian Rupee.Transactions in foreign currency are accounted for at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. Gains / losses arising on settlement as also on translation of monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.Exchange differences arising on monetary items that,  in substance, form part of the Company’s net investment in a foreign operation (having a functional currency other than Indian Rupee) are accumulated in Foreign Currency Translation Reserve. Derivatives\tand\tHedge\tAccountingDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gains / losses are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as  a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of recognition in profit or loss / inclusion in the initial cost of non-financial asset depends on the nature of the hedging relationship and the nature of the hedged item.The Company complies with the principles of hedge accounting where derivative contracts are designated as hedge instruments. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the relationship between the hedge instrument and the hedged item, along with the risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking hedge transaction, which can be a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.(i) Fair value hedges Changes in fair value of the designated portion of derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The change in the fair value of the designated portion of hedging instrument and the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss in the line item relating to the hedged item.  Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date.  (ii) Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated as ‘Cash Flow Hedging Reserve’. The gains / losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the Statement of Profit  and Loss. Amounts previously recognised and accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item affects the Statement of Profit and Loss. However, when the hedged item results in the recognition of a non - financial asset, such gains / losses are transferred from equity (but not as reclassification adjustment) and included in the initial measurement cost of the non - financial asset.  Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gains / losses recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remain in equity and is reclassified when the underlying transaction is ultimately recognised. When an underlying transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gains / losses accumulated in equity are recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.Investment\tin\tSubsidiaries,\tAssociates\tand\tJoint\tVentures Investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are carried at cost less accumul ated impairment, if any.Notes to the Financial Statements\n",

Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value on initial recognition of financial assets or financial liabilities. Purchase or sale of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date when the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.Financial\tAssetsRecognition: Financial assets include Investments, Trade Receivables, Advances, Security Deposits, Cash and Cash equivalents. Such assets are initially recognised at transaction price when the Company becomes party to contractual obligations. The transaction price includes transaction costs unless the asset is being fair valued through the Statement of Profit and Loss. Classification: Management determines the classification of an asset at initial recognition depending on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on such classification.Financial\tassets\tare\tclassified\tas\tthose\tmeasured\tat:  (a) amortised cost, where the financial assets are held solely for collection of cash flows arising from payments of principal and / or interest. (b) fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), where the financial assets are held not only for collection of cash flows arising from payments of principal and interest but also from the sale of such assets. Such assets are subsequently measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value being recognised in other comprehensive income. (c) fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), where the assets are managed in accordance with an approved investment strategy that triggers purchase and sale decisions based on the fair value of such assets.  Such assets are subsequently measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value being recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which th ey arise.Trade Receivables, Advances, Security Deposits, Cash and Cash equivalents etc. are classified for measurement at amortised cost while investments may fall under any of the aforesaid classes. However, in respect of particular investments in equity instruments that would otherwise be measured at fair value through profit or loss, an irrevocable election at initial recognition may be made to present subsequent changes in fair value through other comprehensive income.Impairment: The Company assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) such as investments, trade receivables, advances and security deposits held at amortised cost and financial assets that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are tested for impairment based on evidence or information that is available without undue cost or effort. Expected credit losses are assessed and loss allowances recognised if the credit quality of the financial asset has deteriorated significantly since initial recognition. Reclassification: When and only when the business model is changed, the Company shall reclassify all affected financial assets prospectively from the reclassification date as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss without restating the previously recognised gains, losses or interest and in terms of the reclassification principles laid down in the Ind AS relating to Financial Instruments. Derecognition: Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the assets has expired, or has been transferred, and the Company has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. Concomitantly, if the asset is one that is measured at:(a) amortised cost, the gain or loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss; (b) fair value through other comprehensive income, the cumulative fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss unless the asset represents an equity investment, in which case the cumulative fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are reclassified within equity. Income\tRecognition: Interest income is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the right to receive dividend  is established. Notes to the Financial Statements\n",

      "156 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022 ITC LimitedFinancial\tLiabilitiesBorrowings, trade payables and other financial liabilities are initially recognised at the value of the respective contractual obligations. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any discount or premium on redemption / settlement is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as finance cost over the life of the liability using the effective interest method and adjusted to the liability figure disclosed in the Balance Sheet.Financial liabilities are derecognised when the liability is  extinguished, that is, when the contractual obligation  is discharged, cancelled or on expiry.Offsetting\tFinancial\tInstrumentsFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is included in the Balance Sheet where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.Equity\tInstrumentsEquity instruments are recognised at the value of the proceeds, net of direct costs of the capital issue.RevenueRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered, net of returns and discounts to customers. Revenue from the sale of goods is shown to include Excise Duties and National Calamity Contingent Duty which are payable on manufacture of goods but excludes taxes such as VAT and Goods and Services Tax which are payable in respect of sale of goods and services.Revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised when the Company performs its obligations to its customers and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and recovery of the consideration is probable. The timing of such recognition in case of sale of goods is when the control over the same is transferred to the customer, which is mainly upon delivery and in case of services, in the period in which such services are rendered.Government\tGrantThe Company may receive government grants that require compliance with certain conditions related to the Company’s operating activities or are provided to the Company by way of financial assistance on the basis of certain qualifying criteria. Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received upon the Company complying with the conditions attached to the grant.  Accordingly, government grants:(a) related to or used for assets, are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset.(b) related to incurring specific expenditures are taken to the Statement of Profit and Loss on the same basis and in the same periods as the expenditures incurred.  (c) by way of financial assistance on the basis of certain qualifying criteria are recognised as they become receivable. In the unlikely event that a grant previously recognised is ultimately not received, it is treated as a change in estimate and the amount cumulatively recognised is expensed in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Dividend\tDistributionDividends paid (including income tax thereon) are recognised in the period in which the interim dividends are approved by the Board of Directors, or in respect of the final dividend when approved by shareholders.Employee\tBenefitsThe Company makes contributions to both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes which are mainly administered through duly constituted and approved Trusts.  Provident Fund contributions are in the nature of defined contribution scheme. In respect of employees who are members of constituted and approved trusts, the Company recognises contribution payable to such trusts as an expense including any shortfall in interest between the amount of interest realised by the investment and the interest payable to members at the rate declared by the Government of India. In respect of other employees, provident funds are deposited with the Government and recognised as expense. The Company makes contribution to defined contribution pension plan. The contribution payable is recognised as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. The Company also makes contribution to defined benefit pension and gratuity plan. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. Service costs and net interest expense or income is reflected in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Gain or Loss on account of remeasurements are recognised immediately through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.  The employees of the Company are entitled to compensated leave for which the Company records the liability based on actuarial valuation computed using projected unit credit method. These benefits are unfu nded.1.\t Significant\tAccounting\tPolicies\t(Contd.)Notes to the Financial Statements\n",

Eligible employees for this purpose include employees of the Company including Directors and those on deputation and employees of the Company’s subsidiary companies including Managing Director /  Wholetime Director of a subsidiary.Under Ind AS, the cost of ITC Stock Options (Stock Options) is recognised based on the fair value of Stock Options as on the grant date. While the fair value of Stock Options granted is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss for employees of the Company (other than those out on deputation), the value of Stock Options, net of reimbursements, granted to employees on deputation and to employees of the wholly owned and other subsidiary companies is considered as capital contribution / investment. The Company generally seeks reimbursement of the value of Stock Options from such companies, as applicable.  It may, if so recommended by the Corporate Management Committee and approved by the Audit Committee, decide not to seek such reimbursements from: (a) Wholly owned subsidiaries who need to conserve financial capacity to sustain their business and growth plans and to address contingencies that may arise, taking into account the economic and market conditions then prevailing and opportunities and threats in the competitive context.(b) Other companies not covered under (a) above, who need to conserve financial capacity to sustain their business and growth plans and where the quantum of reimbursement is not material - the materiality threshold being ` 5 Crores for each entity for a financial year.Cash\tSettled\tStock\tAppreciation\tLinked\tReward\t(SAR)\t Plan\tCash Settled SAR units are granted to eligible employees under the ITC Employee Cash Settled Stock Appreciation Linked Reward Plan (“ITC ESARP”). The eligible employees for this purpose are such present and future permanent employees of the Company, including a Director of the Company, as may be decided by the CMC / Nomination & Compensation Committee / Board. For cash settled SAR units granted to eligible employees,  a liability is initially measured at fair value at the grant date  and is subsequently remeasured at each reporting period, until settled. The fair value of ESAR units granted is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss for employees of the Company. In case of employees on deputation to group companies, the Company generally seeks reimbursements from the concerned group company. The value of such payments, net of reimbursements,  is considered as capital contribution / investment. LeasesThe Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains,  a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.Company\tas\ta\tLesseeRight-of-Use (ROU) assets are recognised at inception of a contract or arrangement for significant lease components at cost less lease incentives, if any. ROU assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The cost of ROU assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct cost incurred and lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date. ROU assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and estimated useful lives of the underlying assets on a straight line basis. Lease term is determined based on consideration of facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Lease payments associated with short-term leases and low value leases are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.The Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made on the date of recognition of the lease. Such lease liabilities do not include variable lease payments (that do not depend on an index or a rate), which are recognised as expense in the periods in which they are incurred. Interest on lease liability is recognised using the effective interest method. Lease liabilities are subsequently increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. The carrying amount of lease liabilities is also remeasured upon modification of lease arrangement or upon change in the assessment of the lease term.  The effect of such remeasurements is adjusted to the value of the ROU assets.1.\t Significant\tAccounting\tPolicies\t(Contd.)Notes to the Financial Statements\n",

Where the Company is a lessor under an operating lease, the asset is capitalised within property, plant and equipment or investment property and depreciated over its useful economic life. Payments received under operating leases are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.Taxes\ton\tIncomeTaxes on income comprise current taxes and deferred taxes. Current tax in the Statement of Profit and Loss is provided as the amount of tax payable in respect of taxable income for the period using tax rates and tax laws enacted during the period, together with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for taxation purposes (tax base), at the tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax assets are recognised for the future tax consequences to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.Income tax, insofar as it relates to items disclosed under other comprehensive income or equity, is disclosed separately under other comprehensive income or equity, as applicable.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.ClaimsClaims against the Company not acknowledged as debts are disclosed after a careful evaluation of the facts and legal aspects of the matter involved.Provisions\tProvisions are recognised when, as a result of a past event, the Company has a legal or constructive obligation; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably estimated. The amount so recognised is a best estimate of the consideration required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.In an event when the time value of money is material, the provision is carried at the present value of the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation.Operating\tSegmentsOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker (CODM). The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance  of the operating segments, has been identified as the Corporate Management Committee. Segments are organised based on businesses which have similar economic characteristics as well as exhibit similarities in nature of products and services offered, the nature of production processes, the type and class of customer and distribution methods.Segment revenue arising from third party customers is reported on the same basis as revenue in the financial statements. Inter-segment revenue is reported on the basis of transactions which are primarily market led. Segment results represent profits before finance charges, unallocated corporate expenses and taxes. “Unallocated Corporate Expenses” include revenue and expenses that relate to initiatives  / costs attributable to the enterprise as a whole.Financial\tand\tManagement\tInformation\tSystemsThe Company’s Accounting System is designed to unify the Financial and Cost Records and also to comply with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, to provide financial and cost information appropriate to the businesses and facilitate Internal Control.Notes to the Financial Statements\n",

      "The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the results of operations during the reporting period end. Although these estimates are based upon management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results could differ from these estimates.The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.A.\t Judgements\tin\tapplying\taccounting\tpoliciesThe judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see note B below), that the Company has made in the process of applying its accounting policies and that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in these financial statements pertain to useful life of intangible assets. The Company is required to determine whether its intangible assets have indefinite or finite life which is a subject matter of judgement. Certain trademarks have been considered of having an indefinite useful life taking into account that there are no technical, technological or commercial risks of obsolescence or limitations under contract or law. Other trademarks have been amortised over their useful economic life. Refer notes to the financial statements. B.\t Key\tsources\tof\testimation\tuncertaintyThe following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. 1. \tUseful\tlives\tof\tproperty,\tplant\tand\tequipment,\tinvestment\tproperty\tand\tintangible\tassets:   As described in the significant accounting policies, the Company reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment, investment property and intangible assets at the end of each reporting period. 2. \tFair\tvalue\tmeasurements\tand\tvaluation\tprocesses:   Some of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company uses market-observable data to the extent it is available. Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Company engages third party valuers, where required, to perform the valuation. Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets, liabilities and share based payments are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. 3.\t\tActuarial\tValuation:   The determination of Company’s liability towards defined benefit obligation to employees is made through independent actuarial valuation including determination of amounts to be recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss and in other comprehensive income. Such valuation depends upon assumptions determined after taking into account inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors such as supply and demand factors in the employment market. Information about such valuation is provided in notes to the financial statements.  4.\t Claims,\tProvisions\tand\tContingent\tLiabilities:\t    The Company has ongoing litigations with various regulatory authorities and third parties. Where an outflow of funds is believed to be probable and a reliable estimate of the outcome of the dispute can be made based on management’s assessment of specific circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice, management provides for its best estimate of the liability. Such accruals are by nature complex and can take number of years to resolve and can involve estimation uncertainty. Information about such litigations is provided in notes to the financial statements. 5.\t COVID-19:   The Company has considered the possible effects that may arise out of COVID-19 pandemic on the carrying amounts of property, plant & equipment, intangible assets, investments, inventories, trade receivables, etc. For this purpose, the Company has considered internal and external sources of information up to the date of approval of these financial statements, including credit reports and related information, economic forecasts, market value of certain investments etc. Based on the current estimates, the Company does not expect any significant impact on such carrying values. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s financial statements may differ from that estimated as at the date of approval of these financial statements.\n",

      "Notes:1.  Land includes certain lands at Munger with Gross Block - ` 1.16 Crores (2021 - ` 1.16 Crores) which stood vested with the State of Bihar under the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 for which compensation has not yet been determined.2. a)  Goodwill arising on Business Combination is carried at cost and annually tested for impairment in line with applicable Accounting Standards. The Company has also considered certain acquired Trademarks aggregating ` 1889.78 Crores (2021 - ` 1889.78 Crores) as having indefinite useful lives. The indefinite useful life for such trademarks has been assessed considering no technical, technological or commercial risks of obsolescence or any limitations under contract or law. Such assets are also annually tested for impairment. These assets pertain to the ‘FMCG - Others’ Segment and are related to the Branded Packaged Foods and Personal Care Products businesses of the Company. Impairment testing for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives has been carried out considering their recoverable amounts which, inter-alia, includes estimation of their value-in-use based on management projections. These projections have been made for a period of five years, or longer, as applicable and consider various factors, such as market scenario, growth trends, growth and margin projections, and terminal growth rates specific to the business. For such projections, discount rate of 10% (2021 - 10%) and long-term growth rates ranging between 5% to 6% (2021 - 5% to 6%) have been considered. Discount rate has been determined considering the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of market benchmarks. Based on the above assessment, no impairment has been recognised during the year.2. b) Computer software and Customer Relationships are amortized over a period of 5 years and 8 years respectively. Other Intangibles with finite useful life are amortized over a period of 10 years unless shorter useful life is required based on contractual or legal terms. 3.  The amortization expense of intangible assets has been included under ‘Depreciation and amortization expense’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss.4.  The amount of expenditure recognised in the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment in the course of construction is ` 147.39 Crores (2021 - ` 26.65 Crores).5.  The fair value of the investment property is ` 870.11 Crores (2021 - ` 861.00 Crores). The fair value has been determined on the basis of valuation carried out at the reporting date by registered valuer as defined under rule 2 of Companies (Registered Valuers and Valuation) Rules, 2017 and the same has been categorised as Level 2 based on the valuation techniques used and inputs applied. The main inputs considered by the valuer are government rates, property location, market research & trends, contracted rentals, terminal yields, discount rates and comparable values, as appropriate. Amounts recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in respect of the investment property is as under:\n",

Provident Fund, Pension and Gratuity Benefits are funded and Leave Encashment Benefits are unfunded in nature.  The Defined Benefit Pension Plans are based on employees’ pensionable remuneration and length of service. Under the Provident Fund, Gratuity and Leave Encashment Schemes, employees are entitled to receive lump sum benefits.     The liabilities arising in the Defined Benefit Schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method. The Company makes regular contributions to these Defined Benefit Plans. Additional contributions are made to these plans as and when required based on actuarial valuation. Some Group companies also participate in these Plans. These participating Group companies make contributions to the Plans for their respective employees on a uniform basis and each entity ascertains their obligation through actuarial valuation. The net Defined Benefit cost is recognised by these companies in their respective Financial Statements.   Risk Management    The Defined Benefit Plans expose the Company to risk of actuarial deficit arising out of investment risk, interest rate risk and salary cost inflation risk.     Investment Risk: This may arise from volatility in asset values due to market fluctuations and impairment of assets due to credit losses. These Plans primarily invest in debt instruments such as Government securities and highly rated corporate bonds – the valuation of which is inversely proportional to the interest rate movements.     Interest Rate Risk: The present value of Defined Benefit Plans liability is determined using the discount rate based on the market yields prevailing at the end of reporting period on Government securities. A decrease in yields will increase the fund liabilities and vice-versa.    Salary Cost Inflation Risk: The present value of the Defined Benefit Plan liability is calculated with reference to the future salaries of participants under the Plan. Increase in salary might lead to higher liabilities.     These Plans have a relatively balanced mix of investments in order to manage the above risks. The investment strategy is designed based on the interest rate scenario, liquidity needs of the Plans and pattern of investment as prescribed under various statutes.    The Trustees regularly monitor the funding and investments of these Plans. Risk mitigation systems are in place to ensure that the health of the portfolio is regularly reviewed and investments do not pose any significant risk of impairment. Periodic audits are conducted to ensure adequacy of internal controls. Pension obligation of the employees is secured by purchasing annuities thereby de-risking the Plans fro m future payment obligation. 27. Additional Notes to the Financial Statements (Contd.)\n",

However, Logix Estates Private Limited, Noida, the JV partner communicated its intention to explore alternative development plans to which the Company reiterated that it was committed only to the project as envisaged in the JVA. The JV partner refused to progress the project and instead expressed its intent to exit the JV by selling its stake to the Company and subsequently proposed that both parties should find a third party to sell the entire shareholding in LDPL. The resultant deadlock has stalled the project. The Company’s petition that the affairs of the JV are being conducted in a manner that is prejudicial to the interest of the Company and the JV entity, as also a petition for winding up of LDPL filed by Logix Estates, are currently before the Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone Ind AS financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:•  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. •  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant \n",

Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.•  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. •  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. •  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone Ind AS financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone Ind AS financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2022 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements1.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements.Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to these Standalone Financial StatementsA company’s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference Annexure 2    to the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date on the Standalone Financial Statements of ITC Limited\n",
      "224 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022 ITC Limited\n",
      "to standalone financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Standalone Financial StatementsBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.OpinionIn our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2022, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.\n",

      "1.\t Significant\tAccounting\tPolicies\n",
      "Statement\tof\tComplianceThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with the relevant presentation requirements of the Companies Act, 2013. The Group adopted Ind AS from 1st April, 2016. Basis\tof\tPreparationThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for certain items that are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies.Fair Value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and / or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 102 – Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 116 – Leases, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in Ind AS 2 – Inventories or value in use in Ind AS 36 – Impairment of Assets.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period; they are recognised in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.Basis\tof\tConsolidationThe Consolidated Financial Statements (CFS) include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries together with the share of the total comprehensive income of joint ventures and associates.Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Associates are entities over which the Group exercise significant influence but does not control. An entity / arrangement in which the Group has the ability to exercise control jointly with one or more uncontrolled entities may be a joint venture (“JV”) or a joint operation (“JO”). Unlike in a JV where parties have proportionate interests in the assets and liabilities of the JV entity, parties have rights to and obligations towards specified assets and liabilities in a JO.  Control, significant influence and joint control is assessed annually with reference to the voting power (usually arising from equity shareholdings and potential voting rights) and other rights (usually contractual) enjoyed by the Group in its capacity as an investor that provides it the power and consequential ability to direct the investee’s activities and significantly affect the Group’s returns from its investment. Such assessment requires the exercise of judgement and is disclosed by way of a note to the Financial Statements.  The Group is considered not to be in control of entities where it is unclear as to whether it enjoys such power over the investee.The assets, liabilities, income and expenses of subsidiaries are aggregated and consolidated, line by line, from the date control is acquired by any Group entity to the date it ceases. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the Group as owners and to the non-controlling interests. The Group presents the non-controlling interests in the Balance Sheet within equity, separately from the equity of the Group as owners. The excess of the Group’s investment in a subsidiary over its share in the net worth of such subsidiary on the date control is acquired is treated as goodwill while a deficit is considered as a capital reserve in the CFS. In case of JO, Group’s share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses are consolidated.  On disposal of the subsidiary, attributable amount on goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss and recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Impairment loss, if any, to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount is charged off to the Statement of Profit and Loss as it arises and is not reversed.  For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to Cash Generating Unit (CGU) or a group of CGUs to which it relates, which is not larger than an operating segment, and is monitored for internal management purposes.An investment in an associate or a JV is initially recognised at cost on the date of the investment, and inclusive of any goodwill / capital reserve embedded in the cost, in the \n",

      "Balance Sheet. The proportionate share of the Group in the net profits / losses as also in the other comprehensive income is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss and the carrying value of the investment is adjusted by a like amount (referred as ‘equity method’). All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.Operating\tCycleAll assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements based on the nature of products and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents.Property,\tPlant\tand\tEquipment\t–\tTangible\tAssetsProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. For this purpose, cost includes deemed cost which represents the carrying value of property, plant and equipment recognised as at 1st April, 2015 measured as per the previous Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).Cost is inclusive of inward freight, duties and taxes and incidental expenses related to acquisition. In respect  of major projects involving construction, related  pre-operational expenses form part of the value of assets capitalised. Expenses capitalised also include applicable borrowing costs for qualifying assets, if any. All upgradation /  enhancements are charged off as revenue expenditure unless they bring similar significant additional benefits.An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use which is generally on commissioning. Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated in a manner that amortizes the cost (or other amount substituted for cost) of the assets after commissioning, less its residual value, over their useful lives as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 on a straight line basis. Land is not depreciated.The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment of the Group are as follows: \n",
      "Buildings 30-60 Years Leasehold Improvement Shorter of lease period or estimated useful lives Plant and Equipment 7-25 Years Furniture and Fixtures 8-10 Years Vehicles 8-10 Years Office Equipment 5 Years Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease. Property, plant and equipment’s residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and changes, if any, are treated as changes in accounting estimate. Goodwill\ton\tConsolidationGoodwill arising on consolidation is stated at cost less impairment losses, where applicable. On disposal of a subsidiary, attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. On acquisition of an associate or joint venture, the goodwill / capital reserve arising from such acquisition is included in the carrying amount of the investment and also disclosed separately.Impairment loss, if any, to the extent the carrying amount exceed the recoverable amount is charged off to the Statement of Profit and Loss as it arises and is not reversed. For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to Cash Generating Unit (CGU) or group of CGUs to which it relates, which is not larger than an operating segment, and is monitored for internal management purposes.Intangible\tAssetsIntangible Assets that the Group controls and from which it expects future economic benefits, are capitalised upon acquisition and measured initially:a. for assets acquired in a business combination, at fair value on the date of acquisition; b. for separately acquired assets, at cost comprising the purchase price (including import duties and  non-refundable taxes) and directly attributable costs to prepare the asset for its intended use.Internally generated assets for which the cost is clearly identifiable are capitalised at cost.  Research expenditure is recognised as an expense when it is incurred. Development costs are capitalised only after the technical and commercial feasibility of the asset for sale or use has been established. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n",
      "242 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022 ITC LimitedThereafter, all directly attributable expenditure incurred to prepare the asset for its intended use are recognised as the cost of such assets. Internally generated brands, websites and customer lists are not recognised as intangible assets. The carrying value of intangible assets includes deemed cost which represents the carrying value of intangible assets recognised as at 1st April, 2015 measured as per the previous GAAP.The useful life of an intangible asset is considered finite where the rights to such assets are limited to a specified period of time by contract or law (e.g. patents, licences, trademarks, franchise and servicing rights) or the likelihood of technical, technological obsolescence (e.g. computer software, design, prototypes) or commercial obsolescence (e.g. lesser known brands are those to which adequate marketing support may not be provided). If, there are no such limitations, the useful life is taken to be indefinite.  Intangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives by the straight line method unless it is practical to reliably determine the pattern of benefits arising from the asset. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized.All intangible assets are tested for impairment. Amortization expenses and impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses are taken to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Thus, after initial recognition, an intangible asset is carried at its cost less accumulated amortization and / or impairment losses.The useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed annually to determine if a reset of such useful life is required for assets with finite lives and to confirm that business circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment for assets so classified. Based on such review, the useful life may change or the useful life assessment may change from indefinite to finite. The impact of such changes is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate.Impairment\tof\tAssetsImpairment loss, if any, is provided to the extent, the carrying amount of assets or cash generating units exceed their recoverable amount.Recoverable amount is higher of an asset’s net selling price and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset or cash generating unit and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. Impairment losses recognised in prior years are reversed when there is an indication that the impairment losses recognised no longer exist or have decreased.  Such reversals are recognised as an increase in carrying amounts of assets to the extent that it does not exceed the carrying amounts that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years.Investment\tPropertyProperties that are held for long-term rental yields and / or for capital appreciation are classified as investment properties. Investment properties are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Depreciation is recognised using the straight line method so as to amortize the cost of investment properties over their useful lives as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Freehold land and properties under construction are not depreciated. Transfers to, or from, investment properties are made at the carrying amount when and only when there is a change in use.An item of investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of investment property is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the property and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.Income received from investment property is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.Inventories\t\tInventories are stated at lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost is calculated on weighted average method. Cost comprises expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing such inventories to their present location and condition and includes, where applicable, appropriate overheads based on normal level of activity. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs for completion and sale.Obsolete, slow moving and defective inventories are identified from time to time and, where necessary, a provision is made for such inventories. Foreign\tCurrency\tTransactionsThe presentation currency of the Group is Indian Rupee. Transactions in foreign currency are accounted for at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date.

      "REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022 243 ITC LimitedExchange differences arising on monetary items that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign operation (having a functional currency other than Indian Rupee) are accumulated in foreign currency translation reserve.For the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: (a) assets and liabilities of foreign operations, together with goodwill and fair value adjustments assumed on acquisition thereof, are translated to Indian Rupees at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting period end; (b) income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period; when exchange rates fluctuate significantly the rates prevailing on the transaction date are used instead.Differences arising on such translation are accumulated  in foreign currency translation reserve and attributed to non-controlling interests proportionately.On the disposal of a foreign operation, all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the Group is reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss. In relation to a partial disposal, that does not result in losing control over the subsidiary, the proportionate exchange differences accumulated in equity is reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss.Derivatives\tand\tHedge\tAccountingDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gains / losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of recognition in profit or loss / inclusion in the initial cost of non-financial asset depends on the nature of the hedging relationship and the nature of the hedged item.The Group complies with the principles of hedge accounting where derivative contracts are designated as hedge instruments. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedge instrument and the hedged item, along with the risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking hedge transaction, which can be a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.(i) Fair value hedges Changes in fair value of the designated portion of derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.  The change in the fair value of the designated portion of hedging instrument and the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the line item relating to the hedged item.  Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date.(ii) Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as  cash flow hedges is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated as ‘Cash Flow Hedging Reserve’. The gains / losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the Statement of  Profit and Loss. Amounts previously recognised and accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item affects the Statement of Profit and Loss. However, when the hedged item results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, such gains / losses are transferred from equity (but not as reclassification adjustment) and included in the initial measurement cost of the non-financial asset. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.  Any gains / losses recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remain in equity and is reclassified when the underlying transaction is ultimately recognised. When an underlying transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gains / losses accumulated in equity are recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.Investment\tin\tAssociate\tand\tJoint\tVentureInvestment in associate and joint venture is accounted for using the ‘equity method’ less accumulated impairment,  if any.Financial\tInstrument,\tFinancial\tAssets,\tFinancial\t Liabilities\tand\tEquity\tInstrumentsFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and are initially measured  1.\t Significant\tAccounting\tPolicies\t(Contd.)Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n"

      "244 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022 ITC Limitedat fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value on initial recognition of financial assets or financial liabilities. Purchase or sale of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date when the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.Financial\tAssetsRecognition: Financial assets include Investments, Trade receivables, Advances, Security deposits, Cash and cash equivalents. Such assets are initially recognised at transaction price when the Group becomes party to contractual obligations. The transaction price includes transaction costs unless the asset is being fair valued through the Statement of Profit and Loss.Classification: Management determines the classification of an asset at initial recognition depending on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on such classification.Financial assets are classified as those measured at: (a) amortised cost, where the financial assets are held solely for collection of cash flows arising from payments of principal and / or interest. (b) fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), where the financial assets are held not only for collection of cash flows arising from payments of principal and interest but also from the sale of such assets. Such assets are subsequently measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value being recognised in other comprehensive income. (c) fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), where the assets are managed in accordance with an approved investment strategy that triggers purchase and sale decisions based on the fair value of such assets. Such assets are subsequently measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value being recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.Trade receivables, Advances, Security deposits, Cash and cash equivalents etc. are classified for measurement at amortised cost while investments may fall under any of the aforesaid classes. However, in respect of particular investments in equity instruments that would otherwise be measured at fair value through profit or loss, an irrevocable election at initial recognition may be made to present subsequent changes in fair value through other comprehensive income.Impairment: The Group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) such as Investments, Trade receivables, Advances and Security deposits held at amortised cost and financial assets that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are tested for impairment based on evidence or information that is available without undue cost or effort. Expected credit losses are assessed and loss allowances recognised if the credit quality of the financial asset has deteriorated significantly since initial recognition. Reclassification: When and only when the business model is changed, the Group shall reclassify all affected financial assets prospectively from the reclassification date as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss without restating the previously recognised gains, losses or interest and in terms of the reclassification principles laid down in the Ind AS relating to Financial Instruments.Derecognition: Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the assets has expired, or has been transferred, and the Group has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. Concomitantly, if the asset is one that is measured at:(a) amortised cost, the gain or loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss; (b) fair value through other comprehensive income, the cumulative fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss unless the asset represents an equity investment, in which case the cumulative fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are reclassified  within equity. Income\tRecognition: Interest income is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the right to receive dividend is established.Financial\tLiabilitiesBorrowings, trade payables and other financial liabilities are initially recognised at the value of the respective contractual obligations. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any discount or premium on redemption / settlement is 1.\t Significant\tAccounting\tPolicies\t(Contd.)Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n",
      "REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022 245 ITC Limitedrecognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as finance cost over the life of the liability using the effective interest method and adjusted to the liability figure disclosed in the Balance Sheet. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the liability is  extinguished, that is, when the contractual obligation  is discharged, cancelled or on expiry.Offsetting\tFinancial\tInstrumentsFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is included in the Balance Sheet where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.Equity\tInstrumentsEquity instruments are recognised at the value of the proceeds, net of direct costs of the capital issue.RevenueRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered, net of returns and discounts to customers. Revenue from the sale of goods is shown to include excise duties and National Calamity Contingent Duty which are payable on manufacture of goods but excludes taxes such as VAT and Goods and Services Tax which are payable in respect of sale of goods and services.Revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised when the Group performs its obligations to its customers and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and recovery of the consideration is probable. The timing of such recognition in case of sale of goods is when the control over the same is transferred to the customer, which is mainly upon delivery and in case of services, in the period in which such services are rendered.Government\tGrantGroup entities may receive government grants that  require compliance with certain conditions related to the entity’s operating activities or are provided to the entity  by way of financial assistance on the basis of certain qualifying criteria. Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received upon the Group entity complying with the conditions attached to the grant. Accordingly, government grants:(a) related to or used for assets, are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset. (b) related to incurring specific expenditures are taken to the Statement of Profit and Loss on the same basis and in the same periods as the expenditures incurred.  (c) by way of financial assistance on the basis of certain qualifying criteria are recognised as they become receivable. In the unlikely event that a grant previously recognised is ultimately not received, it is treated as a change in estimate and the amount cumulatively recognised is expensed in the Statement of Profit and Loss.Dividend\tDistributionDividends paid (including income tax thereon) are recognised in the period in which the interim dividends are approved by the Board of Directors, or in respect of the final dividend when approved by shareholders.Employee\tBenefitsThe Group makes contributions to both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes which are mainly administered through duly constituted and approved Trusts.  Provident Fund contributions are in the nature of defined contribution scheme. In respect of employees who are members of constituted and approved trusts, the Group recognises contribution payable to such trusts as an expense including any shortfall in interest between the amount of interest realised by the investment and the interest payable to members at the rate declared by the Government of India. In respect of other employees, provident funds are deposited with the Government and recognised as expense. The Group makes contribution to defined contribution pension plan. The contribution payable is recognised as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. The Group also makes contribution to defined benefit pension and gratuity plan. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. Service costs and net interest expense or income is reflected in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Gain or Loss on account of remeasurements are recognised immediately through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.The employees of the Group are entitled to compensated leave for which the Group records the liability based on actuarial valuation computed using projected unit credit method. These benefits are unfunded.Actual disbursements made under the Workers’ Voluntary Retirement Scheme are accounted as revenue expenses.1.\t Significant\tAccounting\tPolicies\t(Contd.)Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n",
      "246 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022 ITC LimitedEmployee\tShare\tBased\tCompensationStock\tOptionsStock Options are granted to eligible employees under the ITC Employee Stock Option Schemes (“ITC ESOS”), as may be decided by the Nomination & Compensation Committee / Board. Eligible employees for this purpose include employees of the Group entities, their Directors and those on deputation to joint ventures and associates. Under Ind AS, the cost of ITC Stock Options (Stock Options) is recognised based on the fair value of Stock Options as on the grant date. While the fair values of Stock Options granted is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss for employees of the Group (other than those out on deputation), the value of Stock Options, net of reimbursements, granted to employees on deputation is considered as capital contribution / investment. The Group generally seeks reimbursement of the value of Stock Options from such companies, as applicable. It may, if so recommended by the Corporate Management Committee and approved by the Audit Committee, decide not to seek such reimbursements in respect of value of Stock Options from such companies, who need to  conserve financial capacity to sustain their business and growth plans and where the quantum of reimbursement is not material - the materiality threshold being ` 5 Crores for each entity for a financial year.Cash\tSettled\tStock\tAppreciation\tLinked\tReward\t  (SAR)\tPlan\tCash Settled SAR units are granted to eligible employees under the ITC Employee Cash Settled Stock Appreciation Linked Reward Plan (“ITC ESARP”). The eligible employees for this purpose are such present and future permanent employees of the Company, including a Director of the Company, as may be decided by the CMC / Nomination & Compensation Committee / Board.For cash settled SAR units granted to eligible employees, a liability is initially measured at fair value at the grant date and is subsequently remeasured at each reporting period, until settled. The fair value of ESAR units granted is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss for employees of the Group. In case of employees on deputation to group companies, the Company generally seeks reimbursements from the concerned group company. The value of such payments, net of reimbursements, is considered as capital contribution / investment.LeasesThe Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains,  a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.Group\tas\ta\tLesseeRight-of-Use (ROU) assets are recognised at inception of a contract or arrangement for significant lease components at cost less lease incentives, if any. ROU assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The cost of ROU assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct cost incurred and lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date. ROU assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and estimated useful lives of the underlying assets on a straight line basis. Lease term is determined based on consideration of facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Lease payments associated with short-term leases and low value leases are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.The Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made on the date of recognition of the lease. Such lease liabilities do not include variable lease payments (that do not depend on an index or a rate), which are recognised as expense in the periods in which they are incurred. Interest on lease liability is recognised using the effective interest method. Lease liabilities are subsequently increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. The carrying amount of lease liabilities is also remeasured upon modification of lease arrangement or upon change in the assessment of the lease term. The effect of such remeasurements is adjusted to the value of the ROU assets.Group\tas\ta\tLessorLeases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Where the Group is a lessor under an operating lease, the asset is capitalised within property, plant and equipment or investment property and depreciated over its useful economic life. Payments received under operating leases are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.1.\t Significant\tAccounting\tPolicies\t(Contd.)Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n",

      "Taxes\ton\tIncomeTaxes on income comprise current taxes and deferred taxes. Current tax in the Statement of Profit and Loss is provided as the amount of tax payable in respect of taxable income for the period using tax rates and tax laws enacted during the period, together with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for taxation purposes (tax base), at the tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax assets are recognised for the future tax consequences to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.Income tax, insofar as it relates to items disclosed under other comprehensive income or equity, is disclosed separately under other comprehensive income or equity, as applicable.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.ClaimsClaims against the Group not acknowledged as debts are disclosed after a careful evaluation of the facts and legal aspects of the matter involved.Provisions\tProvisions are recognised when, as a result of a past event, the Group has a legal or constructive obligation; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably estimated. The amount so recognised is a best estimate of the consideration required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.In an event when the time value of money is material, the provision is carried at the present value of the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation.Operating\tSegmentsOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker (CODM). The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Corporate Management Committee. Segments are organised based on businesses which have similar economic characteristics as well as exhibit similarities in nature of products and services offered, the nature of production processes, the type and class of customer and distribution methods.Segment revenue arising from third party customers is reported on the same basis as revenue in the financial statements. Inter-segment revenue is reported on the basis of transactions which are primarily market led. Segment results represent profits before finance charges, unallocated corporate expenses and taxes. “Unallocated Corporate Expenses” include revenue and expenses that relate to initiatives  / costs attributable to the enterprise as a whole.

      "248 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022 ITC LimitedThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the results of operations during the reporting period end. Although these estimates are based upon management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results could differ from these estimates.The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.A.\tJudgements\tin\tapplying\taccounting\tpoliciesThe following are the judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see note B below), that the Group have made in the process of applying the accounting policies and that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:1.\t Control: The Group assessed whether or not it has control on its investees based on whether, as an investor, it has the power / rights and consequently the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of its investees unilaterally.  In making this judgement, the Group considered the  absolute size of its holding, the relative size of and dispersion of other shareholders, and whether any contractual arrangements exist between the Company (and its subsidiaries) and other shareholders of the investees.  Based on this, and in accordance with its Accounting Policy, the Group has determined that the entities listed in the notes to the financial statements are the only entities over which Group has control.  The Company is a settlor for certain trusts, i.e., ITC Sangeet Research Academy, ITC Education Trust and ITC Rural Development Trust. The Group while considering the nature and insignificant variability of its return has concluded that it does not ‘control’ these trusts.2.\t Significant\tinfluence:\t The Group assessed whether or not it has significant influence on its investees based on its practical ability to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, though it is not in control or in joint control of these policies. Based on such assessment, the Group determined that the entities listed in the notes to the financial statements are the only entities over which the Group has significant influence, and accordingly associates. 3.\t Joint\tControl:(i) The Group holds 50% of the equity share capital of Maharaja Heritage Resorts Limited, a company involved in operation of hotel properties.  The Group do not consider that it is able to exercise control over the company as the decisions about relevant activities of the company are made jointly between the Group and the co-venturer (who holds 50% of the equity share capital) and both the parties have rights to the net assets of such arrangement.  (ii) The Group holds 26% of the equity share capital of Espirit Hotels Private Limited, a company involved in development of a luxury hotel complex.  The Group has considered that in view of the shareholder agreement, key decisions about relevant activities of such company are made jointly between the Group and the co-venturer (who holds 74% of the equity share capital) and both the parties have rights to the net assets of such arrangement.(iii) The Group holds 27.90% of the equity share capital of Logix Developers Private Limited, a company intended for the purpose of developing a luxury hotel-cum-service apartment complex.  The Group has concluded that the key decisions about relevant activities of such company are made jointly between the Group and the co-venturer (who holds 72.10% of the equity share capital) and both the parties have rights to the net assets of such arrangement.(iv) The Group holds 50% of the equity share capital of ITC Essentra Limited, a company involved in manufacture and sale of filter rods.  The Group has concluded that the key decisions about relevant activities of such company are made jointly between the Group and the co-venturer (who holds 50% of the equity share capital) and both the parties have rights to the net assets of such arrangement.4.\t Useful\tlife\tof\tIntangible\tAssets: The Group is required to determine whether its intangible assets have indefinite or finite life which is a subject matter of judgement. Certain trademarks have been considered of having an indefinite useful life taking into account that there are no technical, technological or commercial risks of obsolescence or limitations under contract or law. Other trademarks have been amortized over their useful economic life.

      "B.\t\tKey\tsources\tof\testimation\tuncertainty The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.1.\t Useful\tlives\tof\tproperty,\tplant\tand\tequipment,\tinvestment\tproperty\tand\tintangible\tassets: As described in the significant accounting policies, the Group reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment, investment property and intangible assets at the end of each reporting period.2.\t Fair\tvalue\tmeasurements\tand\tvaluation\tprocesses: Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market-observable data to the extent it is available. Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Group engages third party valuers, where required, to perform the valuation. Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets, liabilities and share based payments are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.3.\t Actuarial\tValuation: The determination of Group’s liability towards defined benefit obligation to employees is made through independent actuarial valuation including determination of amounts to be recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss and in other comprehensive income. Such valuation depends upon assumptions determined after taking into account inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors such as supply and demand factors in the employment market. Information about such valuation is provided in notes to the financial statements. 4.\t Claims,\tProvisions\tand\tContingent\tLiabilities: The Group has ongoing litigations with various regulatory authorities and third parties. Where an outflow of funds is believed to be probable and a reliable estimate of the outcome of the dispute can be made based on management’s assessment of specific circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice, management provides for its best estimate of the liability. Such accruals are by nature complex and can take number of years to resolve and can involve estimation uncertainty. Information about such litigations is provided in notes to the financial statements.5.\t COVID-19: The Group has considered the possible effects that may arise out of COVID-19 pandemic on the carrying amounts of property, plant & equipment, intangible assets, investments, inventories, trade receivables, etc. For this purpose, the Group has considered internal and external sources of information up to the date of approval of these financial statements, including credit reports and related information, economic forecasts, market value of certain investments etc. Based on the current estimates, the Group does not expect any significant impact on such carrying values. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the Group’s financial statements may differ from that estimated as at the date of approval of these financial statements.

      "Notes: 1. Land includes certain lands at Munger with Gross Block - ` 1.16 Crores (2021 - ` 1.16 Crores) which stood vested with the State of Bihar under the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 for which compensation has not yet been determined. 2. a) Goodwill arising on Business Combination is carried at cost and periodically tested for impairment in line with applicable Accounting Standards. The Company has also considered certain acquired Trademarks aggregating ` 1889.78 Crores (2021 - ` 1889.78 Crores) as having indefinite useful lives. The indefinite useful life for such trademarks has been assessed considering no technical, technological or commercial risks of obsolescence or any limitations under contract or law. Such assets are also annually tested for impairment. These assets pertain to the ‘FMCG - Others’ Segment and are related to the Branded Packaged Foods and Personal Care Products businesses of the Company. Impairment testing for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives has been carried out considering their recoverable amounts which, inter-alia, includes estimation of their value-in-use based on management projections. These projections have been made for a period of five years, or longer, as applicable and consider various factors, such as market scenario, growth trends, growth and margin projections, and terminal growth rates specific to the business. For such projections, discount rate of 10% (2021 - 10%) and long-term growth rates ranging between 5% to 6% (2021 - 5% to 6%) have been considered.  Discount rate has been determined considering the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of market benchmarks. Based on the above assessment, no impairment has been recognised during the year.2. b) Computer software and Customer Relationships are amortized over a period of 5 years and 8 years respectively.  Other Intangibles with finite useful life are amortized over a period of 10 years unless shorter useful life is required based on contractual or legal terms.3. The amortization expense of intangible assets has been included under ‘Depreciation and amortization expense’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss.4. The amount of expenditure recognised in the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment in the course of construction is ` 148.81 Crores (2021 - ` 26.67 Crores).\n",
      "5. The fair value of the investment property is ` 870.11 Crores (2021 - ` 861.00 Crores).  The fair value has been determined on the basis of valuation carried out at the reporting date by registered valuer as defined under rule 2 of Companies (Registered Valuers and Valuation) Rules, 2017 and the same has been categorised as Level 2 based on the valuation techniques used and inputs applied. The main inputs considered by the valuer are government rates, property location, market research & trends, contracted rentals, terminal yields, discount rates and comparable values, as appropriate. Amounts recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in respect of the investment property is as under: \n",

This, despite the fact that SNPL’s cigarette factory was under ‘physical control’ of the Excise authorities and cigarettes produced were duly accounted for and certified as such by the Excise authorities.     The Revenue Authorities for the first time raised excise demands for the financial years 1993-94 and 1994-95, claiming that SNPL could have produced more cigarettes according to the input-output ratio submitted in the year 1990-91. SNPL challenged these excise demands before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal through a writ petition. A division bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal decided the matter in favour of SNPL (the “Division Bench Judgement”) and rejected the above basis of theoretical production. The Ministry of Finance of Nepal filed a review petition before the Full Bench of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal seeking review of the judgement of Division Bench. The Full Bench after hearing both the sides at length upheld the judgement of Division Bench by its order dated October 29, 2009.      Similar demands had been raised for other financial years viz., Excise Demands for FY 1998-99 to FY 2002-03 and Income Tax Demand for FY 2001-02, which were also challenged by SNPL before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal by way of writ petitions and the Court was pleased to allow all the writ petitions setting aside the demands.      Further, the Inland Revenue Department had decided administrative review petitions in favour of SNPL setting aside Value Added Tax demands for the financial years 2001-02 and 2007-08 and Income Tax demand for the  FY 2005-06 following the aforesaid decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal.      During the pendency of the aforementioned review petition before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal and thereafter, the Revenue Authorities raised demands and issued a SCN, in the same subject matter of theoretical production for different years (as listed below), which were also challenged by SNPL by way of writ petitions before Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal between the years 2007 to 2010:      1.

      " / Long Term Compensated Absences - As per Actuarial Valuations as on 31st March, 2022 and recognised in the financial statements in respect of Employee Benefit Schemes:  Description of Plans   The Group makes contributions to both Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution Plans for qualifying employees. These Plans are administered through approved Trusts, which operate in accordance with the Trust Deeds, Rules and applicable Statutes. The concerned Trusts are managed by Trustees who provide strategic guidance with regard to the management of their investments and liabilities and also periodically review their performance.   Provident Fund and Pension Benefits are funded, Gratuity Benefits are both funded as well unfunded; and Leave Encashment Benefits are unfunded in nature. The Defined Benefit Pension Plans are based on employees’ pensionable remuneration and length of service. Under the Provident Fund, Gratuity and Leave Encashment Schemes, employees are entitled to receive lump sum benefits.    The liabilities arising in the Defined Benefit Schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method as at year end. The Group makes regular contributions to these Defined Benefit Plans. Additional contributions are made to these plans as and when required based on actuarial valuation.    Risk Management   The Defined Benefit Plans expose the Group to risk of actuarial deficit arising out of investment risk, interest rate risk and salary cost inflation risk.    Investment Risk: This may arise from volatility in asset values due to market fluctuations and impairment of assets due to credit losses. These Plans primarily invest in debt instruments such as Government securities and highly rated corporate bonds – the valuation of which is inversely proportional to the interest rate movements.    Interest Rate Risk: The present value of Defined Benefit Plans liability is determined using the discount rate based on the market yields prevailing at the end of reporting period on Government securities. A decrease in yields will increase the fund liabilities and vice-versa.   Salary Cost Inflation Risk: The present value of the Defined Benefit Plan liability is calculated with reference to the future salaries of participants under the Plan. Increase in salary might lead to higher liabilities.    These Plans have a relatively balanced mix of investments in order to manage the above risks. The investment strategy is designed based on the interest rate scenario, liquidity needs of the Plans and pattern of investment as prescribed under various statutes.   The Trustees regularly monitor the funding and investments of these Plans. Risk mitigation systems are in place to ensure that the health of the portfolio is regularly reviewed and investments do not pose any significant risk of impairment. Periodic audits are conducted to ensure adequacy of internal controls. Pension obligation of the employees is secured by purchasing annuities thereby de-risking the Plans from future payment obligation.\n",

These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the listed assumptions in isolation. While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation and the asset value changes may offset the impact to some extent. For presenting the sensitivities, the present value of the Defined Benefit Obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the Defined Benefit Obligation presented above. There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in the preparation of the Sensitivity Analysis from previous year.\n",

Financial risk management objectives   Entities comprising the Group have put in place risk management systems as applicable to the respective operations. The following explains the objectives and processes of the Company, being the largest component of the Group: The Company has a system-based approach to risk management, anchored to policies and procedures and internal financial controls aimed at ensuring early identification, evaluation and management of key financial risks (such as market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk) that may arise as a consequence of its business operations as well as its investing and financing activities. Accordingly, the Company’s risk management framework has the objective of ensuring that such risks are managed within acceptable and approved risk parameters in a disciplined and consistent manner and in compliance with applicable regulation. It also seeks to drive accountability in this regard.   Liquidity Risk   The Group’s Current assets aggregate ` 34232.45 Crores (2021 - ` 34991.99 Crores) including Current Investments,  Cash and cash equivalents and Other Bank Balances of ` 16918.70 Crores (2021 - ` 19505.35 Crores) against an aggregate Current liabilities of ` 12163.71 Crores (2021 - ` 10689.68 Crores). Other Non-current liabilities other than lease liabilities  due between one year to three years amounted to ` 112.94 Crores (2021 - ` 176.03 Crores) and Other Non-current liabilities due  after three years amounted to ` 36.41 Crores (2021 - ` 113.05 Crores) on the reporting date. The maturity analysis of undiscounted lease liabilities are disclosed under Note 28 (viii).   Further, while the Group’s total equity stands at ` 62821.87 Crores (2021 - ` 60694.15 Crores), it has non-current borrowings of ` 4.85 Crores (2021 - ` 5.58 Crores). In such circumstances, liquidity risk or the risk that the Group may not be able to settle  or meet its obligations as they become due does not exist.  Market Risk   The Group is not an active investor in equity markets; it holds certain investments in equity for long term value accretion which are accordingly measured at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income. The value of investments in such equity instruments  as at 31st March, 2022 is ` 1615.07 Crores (2021- ` 982.46 Crores). Accordingly, fair value fluctuations arising from market volatility is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. (` in Crores)\n",
      "31. Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures (Contd.)Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n",
      "304 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022 ITC Limited   As the Group is virtually debt-free and its deferred payment liabilities do not carry interest, the exposure to interest rate risk from the perspective of financial liabilities is negligible.    The Group’s investments are predominantly held in bonds / debentures, fixed deposits and debt mutual funds. Mark to market movements in respect of the Group’s investments in bonds / debentures that are held at amortised cost are temporary and get recouped through coupon accruals. Other investments in bonds / debentures are fair valued through the Statement of Profit and Loss to recognise market volatility, which is not considered to be significant. Fixed deposits are held with highly rated banks and companies and have a short tenure and are not subject to interest rate volatility.    The Group also invests in mutual fund schemes of leading fund houses. Such investments are susceptible to market price risk that arise mainly from changes in interest rate which may impact the return and value of such investments. However, given the relatively short tenure of underlying portfolio of the mutual fund schemes in which the Group has invested, such price risk is not significant.    For select agricultural commodities primarily held for trading, futures contracts are used to hedge price risks till positions in the physical market are matched. The carrying value of inventories is adjusted to the extent of fair value movement of the risk being hedged. Such hedges are generally for short time horizons and recognised in profit or loss within the crop cycle and are managed by the business within the approved policy framework. Accordingly, the Group’s net exposure to commodity price risk is considered to be insignificant.  Foreign currency risk   The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currency (mainly US Dollar, Pound Sterling, Euro and Japanese Yen) which are subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, including the Group’s net investments in foreign operations (with a functional currency other than Indian Rupee), are also subject to reinstatement risks.  The carrying amounts of foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities including derivative contracts, are as follows:  (` in Crores)\n",

Within the Group, derivative instruments are largely entered into by the Company. The Company has established risk management policies to hedge the volatility in cashflows arising from exchange rate fluctuations in respect of firm commitments and highly probable forecast transactions, through foreign exchange forward, futures and options contracts. The proportion of forecast transactions that are to be hedged is decided based on the size of the forecast transaction and market conditions. As the counterparty for such transactions are highly rated banks, the risk of their non-performance is considered to be insignificant. The Company uses derivatives to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Where such derivatives are not designated under hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of such hedges are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.    The Company may also designate certain hedges which are entered to manage the volatility in cashflows as a cash flow hedge under hedge accounting. The currency, amount and tenure of such hedges are generally matched to the underlying transaction(s). Changes in the fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedges are recognised as cash flow hedging reserve in Other Comprehensive Income. While the probability of such hedges becoming ineffective is very low, the ineffective portion, if any, is immediately recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \n"

Credit Risk   Each entity comprising the Group manages its own credit risk. The following explains the processes followed by the Company, being the largest component of the Group, to manage its credit risk: Company’s deployment in debt instruments are primarily in Government securities, fixed deposits with highly rated banks and companies; bonds issued by government institutions, public sector undertakings, mutual fund schemes of leading fund houses and certificate of deposits issued by highly rated banks and financial institutions. As these counter parties are Central / State Government, Government institutions / public sector undertakings with investment grade / sovereign credit ratings and taking into account the experience of the Company over time, the counter party risk attached to such assets is considered to be insignificant.    The Group’s investments that are held at amortised cost stood at ` 18598.99 Crores (2021 - ` 14252.66 Crores).    The Company’s customer base is large and diverse limiting the risk arising out of credit concentration. Further, credit is extended in business interest in accordance with guidelines issued centrally and business-specific credit policies that are consistent with such guidelines. Exceptions are managed and approved by appropriate authorities, after due consideration of the counterparty’s credentials and financial capacity, trade practices and prevailing business and economic conditions. The Company’s historical experience of collecting receivables and the level of default indicate that credit risk is low and generally uniform across markets; consequently, trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets. All overdue customer balances are evaluated taking into account the age of the dues, specific credit circumstances, the track record of the counterparty etc. Loss allowances and impairment is recognized, where considered appropriate by responsible management.\n",

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted price included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).    The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using market approach and valuation techniques which maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.   Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs such as foreign exchange spot rates and forward rates at the end of the reporting period, yield curves, risk free rate of returns, volatility etc., as applicable.   Level 3: Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).   If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the fair value is determined using generally accepted pricing models based on a discounted cash flow analysis, with the most significant inputs being the discount rate that reflects the credit risk of counterparty.    The fair value of trade receivables, trade payables and other Current financial assets and liabilities is considered to be equal to the carrying amounts of these items due to their short – term nature. Where such items are Non-current in nature, the same has been classified as Level 3 and fair value determined using discounted cash flow basis. Similarly, unquoted equity instruments where most recent information to measure fair value is insufficient, or if there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements, cost has been considered as best estimate of fair value and has been excluded in the fair value measurement disclosed above.   There has been no change in the valuation methodology for Level 3 inputs during the year. The Group has not classified any material financial instruments under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year.On behalf of the BoardS. PURI Chairman & Managing Director R. TANDON Director S. DUTTA Chief Financial Officer R. K.

Our opinion on the consolidated Ind AS financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated Ind AS financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated Ind AS financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. \n",
      "  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i)  of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n",

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associates and joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern. \n",

As indicated in Note 28 (ii)(d) of the Ind AS Consolidated financial statements, in respect of a joint venture, consolidated based on management accounts, the audit report under Companies (Auditors Report) Order, 2020 of the company has not been issued till the date of our auditor’s report. \n",
      "Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of ITC Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding Company”) as of and for the year ended March 31, 2022, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), its associates and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, as of  that date. Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group, its associates and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013. Auditor’s ResponsibilityOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company’s internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both, issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.Annexure 1  referred to in paragraph 1 under the heading “Report on Other legal and Regulatory Requirements” of our report of even date\n",

      "REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022 317 ITC LimitedOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements.Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Consolidated Financial StatementsA company’s internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Consolidated Financial StatementsBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.OpinionIn our opinion, the Group, its associates and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, have, maintained in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and  such internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were operating effectively as at  March 31, 2022, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. Other MattersOur report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company, in so far as it relates to these ten subsidiaries, six associates and two joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures incorporated in Ind ia. \n",

In this context, the Company has laid down a four layered mechanism to deal with the aspect of stakeholder engagement. The Board, through the CSR and Sustainability Committee, inter alia, reviews, monitors and provides strategic direction to the Company’s CSR and sustainability practices towards fulfilling its Triple Bottom Line objectives. Half-yearly reports on the progress made by the Company in this regard are placed by the CMC before the CSR and Sustainability Committee. The CMC in turn has constituted the Sustainability Compliance Review Committee (SCRC), comprising senior members of management, which evaluates and monitors compliance with the Policy formulated in this connection. The SCRC places a quarterly report on the subject before the CMC. 2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.The Company believes that an effective stakeholder engagement process is necessary for achieving its sustainability goal of inclusive growth. Accordingly, it anchors stakeholder engagement on the following principles:a) Materiality – Prioritised consideration of the economic, environmental and social impacts identified to be important to the stakeholders as well as the organisation.b) Completeness – Understanding key concerns of stakeholders and their expectations.c) Responsiveness – Responding coherently and transparently to such issues and concerns.The Company has put in place systems and procedures to identify, prioritise and address the needs and concerns of its stakeholders across businesses and units in a continuous, consistent and systematic manner. It has implemented mechanisms to facilitate effective dialogue with all stakeholders across businesses, identify material concerns and their resolution in an equitable and transparent manner. These measures have helped the Company develop strong relationships, which have stood the test of time. Select examples of how stakeholder inputs have been incorporated into ITC policies and activities are presented below:1. Investors: In addition to its ongoing interactions with analysts representing institutional equity investors on a regular basis post-results, the Company has, over the last two years, been supplementing its quarterly earnings press releases with detailed investor presentations. This is but one example of how the Company has refined its processes emanating from interactions with them. This year, the Company organised its first-ever ‘Institutional Investors and Financial Analysts Day’ for institutional investors, a well attended programme that drew participation from domestic as well as global investors, to provide deeper insights into ITC’s Corporate Strategy and operating segments including, inter alia, their competitive strengths, unique value propositions and key drivers of growth and profitability. These initiatives have been much appreciated by the investor community. The Company is well-recognised for its ESG credentials, and is acknowledged as one of the pioneers of adopting the Triple Bottom Line philosophy in India. Recognising the growing investor interest in this area and factoring in feedback from investor interactions, the Company also periodically reviews, refines and updates its ESG policies on the Company’s portal, as it progresses towards its clearly-defined 2030 goals.2.

      "A portal called Aikyam, captures ideas and feedback provided by our partners, which are evaluated and taken forward by the business. This has enabled both product enhancements and process efficiencies.Rapidly evolving consumer needs are constantly being monitored through social listening, in-depth immersions and are being carefully synthesised to transform into relevant solutions. Some examples are mentioned below:• Launching of products like ITC Masterchef’s ‘IncrEdible’ Plant-based range, a sustainable alternative to meat. This range supports consumers with vegan preferences, and also helps in reducing carbon footprint.• Providing choices to consumers with specific needs like – - Aashirvaad Svasti Milk for lactose intolerant consumers. - Aashirvaad’s Organic Range and Nature’s Super Foods Range for consumers looking for healthier options.• YiPPee! A Better World programme for children that entails a series of workshops for creating awareness on segregation at source, and arts and crafts sessions for teaching them how to make useful objects out of waste materials available at home. 3. Employees: ITC is committed to creating an inclusive, equitable and diverse workplace where every employee feels valued and included. This requires continuous engagement with employees and understand their experiences. This understanding enables ITC to refresh its policies, and ensures that the important enablers of inclusion, such as work-life balance, flexibility in work and benefits are addressed in a relevant, timely and effective fashion. A series of focused group discussions were conducted to understand the employee experiences whilst framing the policies on Gender Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. More than 150 employees (around 10% of the target population) were part of the discussions. The discussions gave rich insight about the priority issues such as flexible work arrangements and employee benefits across various life stages such as maternity. Such nuanced insights enabled the policies to effectively address the requirements of employees.4. Community: A comprehensive stakeholder engagement exercise was first undertaken in 2015-16, wherein core areas were defined and needs of the communities residing in these areas, that is, factory and agri-catchments were identified and prioritised. It emerged that one of the overarching problems faced by the communities were related to lack of sustainable livelihoods today and tomorrow. Based on this, Core Area Perspective Plan (CAPP) was conceptualised and Two Horizons approach to address the needs of the community was developed and adopted. During FY 2021-22, changes in emerging needs and priorities of communities was revisited through CAPP 2.0 by carrying out an exploratory exercise across 3,718 villages in 21 factory and 7 agri-catchments with following objectives:• To revisit coverage and community needs in the changed context;• To assess reasons for not achieving the earlier planned outcomes (if any); and• To re-strategise ITC’S Social Investments Programme (SIP) themes and approach based on the findings.The CAPP 2.0 exercise was carried out by involving third party organisations and NGO partners under close supervision of SIP’s state teams who were present during the data collection exercise. The assessment involved primary and secondary data collection using quantitative and qualitative tools through 6,771 Household Surveys, 169 Key Informant Interviews, 656 Focus Group Discussions and 168 Participatory Rural Appraisal Exercises.The above process ensures that stakeholder inputs, suggestions and needs are appropriately incorporated in SIP’s interventions. For example, SIP’s water stewardship programme initially focused on supply side augmentation through watershed development. However, it emerged during the interactions with stakeholders and through studies that a more comprehensive approach is required for drought proofing agriculture and achieving positive water balance. To address the issue, river basin level interventions were planned and demand side management of water use in agriculture was incorporated in the programme. Similarly, in SIP’s Vocational Training programme, the trades are decided based on regular community feedback and market demand in specific geographical regions. For instance, demand for bedside nursing increased during the pandemic, hence training on bedside nursing trade was amplified. Similarly, based on the feedback received from students placed in various organisations, post-placement assistance was incorporated in the Vocational Training programme.3.

      "hereunder are a few instances wherein changing community needs in unprecedented pandemic situation were addressed through modifications in ongoing programme components as well as through introducing entirely new activities under the programmes.• Digitalisation Activities: The unprecedented situation created by the pandemic posed several challenges for SIP operations and necessitated a rethink and redesign of some interventions. The SIP team proactively addressed these challenges through contextual solutions and actions planned in consultation with key stakeholders. Currently, there are several tools in practice for Learning Management and for enablement of programme implementation.a. Learning Management Systems have been developed in the form of web portal for training of teachers in West Bengal, vocational training of students in Assam, Karnataka and West Bengal, and training of Urban Local Bodies on Solid Waste Management in Uttar Pradesh.b. Digital Platforms for Enabling Programme Implementation: Application (App) based training of Anganwadi workers on Mother & Child Healthcare in Assam and West Bengal, App for command area in Maharashtra, App for crop survey in Tamil Nadu, App for Soil and Moisture Conservation, and Swachh Mitra App for collection and reporting of daily waste data in Uttarakhand.• Smart Mom Intervention: ITC’s education programme adopted remote engagement activities with children after the first wave of COVID 19 pandemic that continued this year too. “Catch Up Campaign” was initiated where mohalla level learning camps were organised to build/rebuild foundational reading and math skills. Subsequently, when schools started re-opening, “Readiness campaign” was initiated to help children of grade 1 and 2, to get ready for school by leveraging community support of mothers. For this, mothers’ groups were formed who were trained on Activity Based Learning method. Since the mothers required support for continuing Activity Based Learning at home, active women from these groups were selected as “Smart Moms” and were trained on the pedagogy to help other group members conduct learning activities for their children. This helped in continuing learning activities for children under Read India Programme despite disturbances of frequent lockdowns and school closures. • Small Ruminants Programme: Diversification of livelihoods to build resilience as well as to support family income emerged as one of the prominent needs during engagement with rural women. Hence, a programme was initiated to build capacity of rural poor women for providing health assistance to small ruminants like goats. The programme not only provided a sustainable livelihood option to participating women, but also provided opportunities for living a dignified life, and contribute towards household income.\n",

The Code is shared and accepted by all supply chain partners and service providers.The company has been progressively increasing the coverage of its Scope 3 emissions by including more Supply Chain partners in its reporting boundary. The scope of coverage for Scope 3 emission is mentioned in ‘Building Climate Resilience’ section of ITC Sustainability & Integrated Report 2022.While working towards reducing its emissions and greening its energy portfolio, ITC seeks to increase carbon sequestration by expanding forestry projects on wastelands. The Farm Forestry programme by ITC’s Paperboards & Specialty Papers Business was started for promoting sustainable forests management practices in the value chain, and securing the supply of pulpwood for its paper mills.

      "ITC has a robust process of evaluating its Suppliers and Service Providers before engaging with them, proactively making them aware of its expectations/requirements, and seeking commitment for compliance through contractual agreements. ITC reserves the right to verify compliance with this Code at any time through appropriate audit and assessment mechanisms, including self-certification. ITC is also committed to reinforcing awareness of this Code amongst the Suppliers and Service Providers and to support them in this endeavour.ITC has identified material environmental impacts across its value chain, and has deployed various mitigation and adaptation strategies.For example, managing hazardous chemicals is not only important within ITC factories but also in the supply chain. Within the supply chain, farmers working with hazardous pesticides is an area of special attention. ITC’s approach is to eliminate or reduce the use of hazardous pesticides. Intensive training is conducted on Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which helps adopt a holistic approach in reducing pesticide usage as well as substituting such pesticides with nature-based solutions. The training programmes also cover the safe handling of pesticides used and the responsible management of wastes generated.For more details, refer to ‘Next-Generation Agriculture’ section of ITC Sustainability & Integrated Report 2022.9. Percentage of value chain partners (by value of business done with such partners) that were assessed for environmental impacts.ITC is guided by a comprehensive set of Board approved Sustainability Policies. The Policies outline the Company’s commitment to high standards on environment and provide the necessary framework to address the direct environmental impacts of Company’s own operations as well as progressively extend the efforts to its supply chain.Key value chain partners like third party manufacturers are encouraged to adopt management practices detailed under International Standards such as ISO 9001, ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and ITC’s Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines. Contract manufacturing agreements provide for compliance with accepted standards on issues related to EHS, human rights and labour practices, and third party manufacturers are periodically assessed to ensure compliance.Farmers constitute a major portion of ITC’s value chain, and accordingly the Company has deployed large scale programmes to both assess and address the environmental impacts across its key agri value chains. For example, ITC’s leaf tobacco value chain is assessed as part of the global Sustainable Tobacco Programme (STP 2.0) which focuses on Water, Human Rights, Crop, Soil, Climate Change, Natural Habitats, Livelihoods and Governance. For more details, refer to the ‘Next-Generation Agriculture’ section of ITC Sustainability & Integrated Report 2022.As a part of reporting for supply chain, ITC has instituted systems to report environmental data for key Third Party Manufacturing (TPM) units and plans to progressively expand its reporting boundary. ITC also supports its TPM units by providing knowledge support in specific areas like energy, water and waste management. Through monitoring and reporting of environmental related data, and through sharing of good practices, ITC aims to positively influence the performance of its supply chain partners.\n",
